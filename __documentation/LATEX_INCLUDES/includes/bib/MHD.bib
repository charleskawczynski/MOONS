abstract = {This paper addresses liquid-metal flow under a strong, fringing, decreasing magnetic field in an insulating circular pipe by a full resolution of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. The aims of the paper are first to provide a detailed description of the flow and second to perform a study of the restrictions related to the approximate numerical techniques commonly used in the nuclear fusion field, namely, the so-called core flow approximation based on asymptotic methods. Finally, a comparison between full MHD solutions obtained under conducting and insulating circular pipe walls, at similar MHD conditions, is provided. The current results show that the role of inertia is clearly more important under electrically insulating ducts because no net braking MHD forces are present in such configurations. This fact adversely affects the accuracy of asymptotic method results. From a phenomenological point of view, the effects of wall conductivity are found to be very important. For instance, when insulating walls are present, the intensity of the generated near-wall jets is three times larger than that found in conducting configurations. As a result, the shear effects and the triggering of turbulence in the downstream area are clearly enhanced.},

abstract = {We investigate the effects of the consistency of strong fringing decreasing magnetic fields on numerical simulations of classical experimental data. Studies about fringing magnetic fields have attracted the attention of the fusion community in relation to the design of the liquid-metal flow blankets for fusion nuclear reactors. One-dimensional fitting functions neglecting magnetic field consistency have been adopted in previous numerical studies. Thanks to complete three-dimensional numerical simulations, the effect of the physical consistency of the magnetic field on fluid flow can now be assessed. We present a technique for generating discretely consistent magnetic fields based on classical one-dimensional fittings. With this method, key magnetic field features, such as the bending of the magnetic lines, are accurately reproduced and, therefore, the validity of the technique is established. Consistent and inconsistent magnetic fields have been tested under very strong decreasing magnetic fields with insulating and conducting walls using direct numerical simulations. The results show a moderate, but systematic, improvement of the predictions with respect to the experiments. As an example, the repeated under-prediction of the peak transverse pressure gradient, observed in the results of asymptotic methods and of direct numerical simulations, is explained by the historically neglected consistency of the fringing magnetic field. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The other goal of this paper is to show that the same well-designed second order accurate schemes can be formulated for more complex geometries such as cylindrical and spherical geometry. Being able to do divergence-free reconstruction in those geometries also resolves the problem of doing AMR in those geometries. The resulting MHD scheme has been implemented in Balsara's RIEMANN framework for parallel, self-adaptive computational astrophysics. The present work also shows that divergence-free reconstruction and the divergence-free time-update can be done for numerical MHD on unstructured meshes.

abstract = {In a pair of earlier papers the author showed the importance of divergence-free reconstruction in adaptive mesh refinement problems for magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and the importance of the same for designing robust second order schemes for MHD. Second order accurate divergence-free schemes for MHD have shown themselves to be very useful in several areas of science and engineering. However, certain computational MHD problems would be much benefited if the schemes had third and higher orders of accuracy. In this paper we show that the reconstruction of divergence-free vector fields can be carried out with better than second order accuracy. As a result, we design divergence-free weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes for MHD that have order of accuracy better than second. A multi-stage Runge-Kutta time integration is used to ensure that the temporal accuracy matches the spatial accuracy. While this is achieved quite simply up to third order in time, going beyond third order is most simply achieved by using the ADER-WENO schemes that are detailed in a companion paper. (ADER stands for Arbitrary Derivative Riemann Problem.) Accuracy analysis is carried out and it is shown that the schemes meet their design accuracy for smooth problems. Stringent tests are also presented showing that the schemes perform well on those tests. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Several physical systems, such as nonrelativistic and relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), radiation MHD, electromagnetics, and incompressible hydrodynamics, satisfy Stoke's law type equations for the divergence-free evolution of vector fields. In this paper we present a full-fledged scheme for the second-order accurate, divergence-free evolution of vector fields on an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) hierarchy. We focus here on adaptive mesh MHD. However, the scheme has applicability to the other systems of equations mentioned above. The scheme is based on making a significant advance in the divergence-free reconstruction of vector fields. In that sense, it complements the earlier work of D. S. Balsara and D. S. Spicer (1999, J. Comput. Phys.7, 270) where we discussed the divergence-free time-update of vector fields which satisfy Stoke's law type evolution equations. Our advance in divergence-free reconstruction of vector fields is such that it reduces to the total variation diminishing (TVD) property for one-dimensional evolution and yet goes beyond it in multiple dimensions. For that reason, it is extremely suitable for the construction of higher order Godunov schemes for MHD. Both the two-dimensional and three-dimensional reconstruction strategies are developed. A slight extension of the divergence-free reconstruction procedure yields a divergence-free prolongation strategy for prolonging magnetic fields on AMR hierarchies. Divergence-free restriction is also discussed. Because our work is based on an integral formulation, divergence-free restriction and prolongation can be carried out on AMR meshes with any integral refinement ratio, though we specialize the expressions for the most popular situation where the refinement ratio is two. Furthermore, we pay attention to the fact that in order to efficiently evolve the MHD equations on AMR hierarchies, the refined meshes must evolve in time with time steps that are a fraction of their parent mesh's time step. An electric field correction strategy is presented for use on AMR meshes. The electric field correction strategy helps preserve the divergence-free evolution of the magnetic field even when the time steps are subcycled on refined meshes. The above-mentioned innovations have been implemented in Balsara's RIEMANN framework for parallel, self-adaptive computational astrophysics, which supports both nonrelativistic and relativistic MHD. Several rigorous, three-dimensional AMR-MHD test problems with strong discontinuities have been run with the RIEMANN framework showing that the strategy works very well. In our AMR-MHD scheme, the adaptive mesh hierarchy can change in response to discontinuities that move rapidly with respect to the mesh. Time-step subcycling permits efficient processing of the AMR hierarchy. Our AMR-MHD scheme parallelizes very well as shown by Balsara and Norton [8].},

abstract = {The equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) have been formulated as a hyperbolic system of conservation laws. In that form it becomes possible to use higher order Godunov schemes for their solution. This results in a robust and accurate solution strategy. However, the magnetic field also satisfies a constraint that requires its divergence to be zero at all times. This is a property that cannot be guaranteed in the zone centered discretizations that are favored in Godunov schemes without involving a divergence cleaning step. In this paper we present a staggered mesh strategy which directly uses the properly upwinded fluxes that are provided by a Godunov scheme. The process of directly using the upwinded fluxes relies on a duality that exists between the fluxes obtained from a higher order Godunov scheme and the electric fields in a plasma. By exploiting this duality we have been able to construct a higher order Godunov scheme that ensures that the magnetic field remains divergence-free up to the computer's round-off error. We have even presented a variant of the basic algorithm that uses multidimensional features in the flow to design an upwinded strategy that aligns itself with the predominant upwinded direction in the flow. We have devised several stringent test problems to show that the scheme works robustly and accurately in all situations. In doing so we have shown that a scheme that involves a collocation of magnetic field variables that is different from the one traditionally favored in the design of higher order Godunov schemes can nevertheless offer the same robust and accurate performance of higher order Godunov schemes provided the properly upwinded fluxes from the Godunov methodology are used in the scheme's construction.},

abstract = {A conservative coupled finite difference-boundary element computational procedure for the simulation of turbulent magnetohydrodynamic flow in a straight rectangular duct at finite magnetic Reynolds number is presented. The flow is assumed to be periodic in the streamwise direction and is driven by a mean pressure gradient. The duct walls are considered to be electrically insulated. The co-evolution of the velocity and magnetic fields as described respectively by the Navier-Stokes and the magnetic induction equations, together with the coupling of the magnetic field between the conducting domain and the non-conducting exterior, is solved using the magnetic field formulation. The aim is to simulate localized magnetic fields interacting with turbulent duct flow. Detailed verification of the implementation of the numerical scheme is conducted in the limiting case of low magnetic Reynolds number by comparing with the results obtained using a quasistatic approach that has no coupling with the exterior. The rigorous procedure with non-local magnetic boundary conditions is compared with simplified pseudo-vacuum boundary conditions and the differences are quantified. Our first direct numerical simulations of turbulent Hartmann duct flow at moderate magnetic Reynolds numbers and a low flow Reynolds number show significant differences in the duct flow turbulence, even at low interaction level between the flow and magnetic field.},

abstract = {Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of a turbulent channel flow at low Reynolds number (Re/sub tau /=100,200,400, where Re/sub tau / is the Reynolds number based on the wall- shear velocity and channel half-width) are carried out to examine the effectiveness of using the Lorentz force to reduce skin friction. The Lorentz force is created by embedding electrodes and permanent magnets in the flat surface over which the flow passes. Both open-loop and closed-loop control schemes are examined. For open-loop control, both temporally and spatially oscillating Lorentz forces in the near-wall region are tested. It is found that skin-friction drag can be reduced by approximately 40{\%} if a temporally oscillating spanwise Lorentz force is applied to a Re/sub tau /=100 channel flow. However, the power to generate the required Lorentz force is an order of magnitude larger than the power saved due to the reduced drag. Simulations were carried out at higher Reynolds numbers (Re/sub tau /=200,400) to determine whether efficiency, defined as the ratio of the power saved to the power used, improves with increasing Reynolds number. We found that the efficiency decreases with increasing Reynolds number. An idealized wall-normal Lorentz force is effected by detecting the near-wall turbulent events responsible for high-skin friction. It is found that the drag can be significantly reduced with a greater efficiency than that produced by the spanwise open-loop control approach. This result suggests that, when employed with a closed-loop control scheme, the Lorentz force might result in a net decrease of power required to propel objects through viscous conducting fluids (26 Refs.)},

abstract = {We propose that the overlapping shock fronts from young supernova remnants produce a locally unsteady, but globally steady large scale spiral shock front in spiral galaxies, where star formation and therefore massive star explosions correlate geometrically with spiral structure. This global shock front with its steep gradients in temperature, pressure and associated electric fields will produce drifts, which in turn give rise to a strong sheet-like electric current, we propose. This sheet current then produces a large scale magnetic field, which is regular, and connected to the overall spiral structure. This rejuvenates the overall magnetic field continuously, and also allows to understand that there is a regular field at all in disk galaxies. This proposal connects the existence of magnetic fields to accretion in disks. We not yet address all the symmetries of the magnetic field here; the picture proposed here is not complete. X-ray observations may be able to test it already.},

We first vary the aspect ratio lambda of the computational box and show that the system runs through a sequence of convective patterns, and that it is only for a sufficiently wide box (lambda{\textgreater}=6) that the flow becomes insensitive to further increases in lambda. Next, setting lambda=6, we decrease the field strength from a value strong enough to halt convection and find transitions to small-scale steady convection, next to spatially modulated oscillations (first periodic, then chaotic) and then to a new regime of flux separation, with regions of strong field (where convection is almost completely suppressed) separated by broad convective plumes. We also explore the effects of altering the boundary conditions and show that this sequence of transitions is robust. Finally, we relate these model calculations to recent high-resolution observations of solar magnetoconvection, in plage regions as well as in light bridges and the umbrae of sunspots.},

abstract = {The usefulness of high-order schemes in astrophysical MHD turbulence simulations is discussed. Simple advection tests of hat profiles are used to compare schemes of different order. Higher order schemes generally need less explicit diffusion. In the case of a standing Burgers shock it is shown that the overall accuracy improves as the order of the scheme is increased. A memory efficient 3-step 2N-RK scheme is used. For cache efficiency, the entire set of equations is solved along pencils in the yz-plane. The advantage of solving for the magnetic vector potential is highlighted. Finally, results from a simulation of helical turbulence exhibiting large scale dynamo action are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We use three-dimensional simulations to study compressible convection in a rotating frame with magnetic fields and overshoot into surrounding stable layers. The, initially weak, magnetic field is amplified and maintained by dynamo action and becomes organized into flux tubes that are wrapped around vortex tubes. We also observe vortex buoyancy which causes upward flows in the cores of extended downdraughts. An analysis of the angles between various vector fields shows that there is a tendency for the magnetic field to be parallel or antiparallel to the vorticity vector, especially when the magnetic field is strong. The magnetic energy spectrum has a short inertial range with a slope compatible with k(+1/3) during the early growth phase of the dynamo. During the saturated state the slope is compatible with k(-1). A simple analysis based on various characteristic timescales and energy transfer rates highlights important qualitative ideas regarding the energy budget of hydromagnetic dynamos.},

abstract = {Using direct simulations of hydromagnetic turbulence driven by random polarized waves it is shown that dynamo action is possible over a wide range of magnetic Prandtl numbers from 10{\^{}}-3 to 1. Triply periodic boundary conditions are being used. In the final saturated state the resulting magnetic field has a large-scale component of Beltrami type. For the kinematic phase, growth rates have been determined for magnetic Prandtl numbers between 0.01 and 1, but only the case with the smallest magnetic Prandtl number shows large-scale magnetic fields. It is less organized than in the nonlinear stage. For small magnetic Prandtl numbers the growth rates are comparable to those calculated from an alpha squared mean-field dynamo. In the linear regime the magnetic helicity spectrum has a short inertial range compatible with a -5/3 power law, while in the nonlinear regime it is the current helicity whose spectrum may be compatible with such a law. In the saturated case, the spectral magnetic energy in the inertial range is in slight excess over the spectral kinetic energy, although for small magnetic Prandtl numbers the magnetic energy spectrum reaches its resistive cut off wavenumber more quickly. The viscous energy dissipation declines with the square root of the magnetic Prandtl number, which implies that most of the energy is dissipated via Joule heat.},

abstract = {The nonlinear evolution of magnetized Keplerian shear flows is simulated in a local, three-dimensional model, including the effects of compressibility and stratification. Supersonic flows are initially generated by the Balbus-Hawley magnetic shear instability. The resulting flows regenerate a turbulent magnetic field which, in turn, reinforces the turbulence. Thus, the system acts like a dynamo that generates its own turbulence. However, unlike usual dynamos, the magnetic energy exceeds the kinetic energy of the turbulence by a factor of 3-10. By assuming the field to be vertical on the outer (upper and lower) surfaces we do not constrain the horizontal magnetic flux. Indeed, a large-scale toroidal magnetic field is generated, mostly in the form of toroidal flux tubes with lengths comparable to the toroidal extent of the box. This large-scale field is mainly of even (i.e., quadrupolar) parity with respect to the midplane and changes direction on a timescale of ˜30 orbits, in a possibly cyclic manner. The effective Shakura-Sunyaev alpha viscosity parameter is between 0.001 and 0.005, and the contribution from the Maxwell stress is ˜3-7 times larger than the contribution from the Reynolds stress.},

abstract = {Young solar-type stars rotate rapidly and many are magnetically active; some undergo magnetic cycles similar to the 22-year solar activity cycle. We conduct simulations of dynamo action in rapidly rotating suns with the 3D MHD anelastic spherical harmonic (ASH) code to explore dynamo action achieved in the convective envelope of a solar-type star rotating at 5 times the current solar rotation rate. Striking global-scale magnetic wreaths appear in the midst of the turbulent convection zone and show rich time-dependence. The dynamo exhibits cyclic activity and undergoes quasi-periodic polarity reversals where both the global-scale poloidal and toroidal fields change in sense on a roughly 1500 day time scale. These magnetic activity patterns emerge spontaneously from the turbulent flow and are more organized temporally and spatially than those realized in our previous simulations of the solar dynamo. We assess in detail the competing processes of magnetic field creation and destruction within our simulations that contribute to the global-scale reversals. We find that the mean toroidal fields are built primarily through an {\$}\backslashOmega{\$}-effect, while the mean poloidal fields are built by turbulent correlations which are not necessarily well represented by a simple {\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-effect. During a reversal the magnetic wreaths propagate towards the polar regions, and this appears to arise from a poleward propagating dynamo wave. The primary response in the convective flows involves the axisymmetric differential rotation which shows variations associated with the poleward propagating magnetic wreaths. In the Sun, similar patterns are observed in the poleward branch of the torsional oscillations, and these may represent poleward propagating magnetic fields deep below the solar surface. [abridged]},

abstract = {In the helium-cooled lead lithium (HCLL) blanket, which has been chosen as a reference concept for a liquid-metal breeding blanket to be tested in ITER, the heat is removed by helium cooled plates aligned with the strong toroidal magnetic field that confines the fusion plasma. The liquid breeder lead lithium circulates through gaps of rectangular cross-section between the cooling plates to transport the generated tritium towards external extraction facilities. Under the action of the strong magnetic field, liquid metal flows in conducting rectangular ducts exhibit jet-like velocity profiles in the thin boundary layers near the side walls, which are parallel to the magnetic field like the cooling plates in HCLL blankets. The velocity in these side layers may exceed several times the mean velocity in the duct and it is known that these layers become unstable for sufficiently high Reynolds numbers. The present paper summarizes experimental results for such unstable time-dependent flows in strong magnetic fields, which have been obtained in the MEKKA liquid metal laboratory of the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe. In particular, spatial and temporal scales of perturbation patterns are identified. The results suggest that the flow between cooling plates in a HCLL blanket is laminar and stable. The observed time-dependent flow behavior appears at larger velocities so that the present results are more relevant for applications in dual coolant concepts where high-velocity jets have been predicted along side walls. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The main object of the paper is to discuss the possibility of a body of homogeneous fluid acting as a self-exciting dynamo. The discussion is for the most part confined to the solution of Maxwell's equations for a sphere of electrically conducting fluid in which there are specified velocities. Solutions are obtained by expanding the velocity and the fields in spherical harmonics to give a set of simultaneous linear differential equations which are solved by numerical methods. Solutions exist when harmonics up to degree four are included. The convergence of the solutions when more harmonics are included is discussed, but convergence has not been proved. The simultaneous solution of Maxwell's equations and the hydrodynamic equations has not been attempted, but a velocity system has been chosen that seems reasonable from a dynamical point of view. A parameter in the velocity system has been adjusted to satisfy the conservation of angular momentum in a rough way. Orders of magnitude are derived for a number of quantities connected with the dynamo theory of terrestrial magnetism. It is concluded that the dynamo theory does provide a self-consistent account of the origin of the earth's magnetic field and raises no insuperable difficulties in other directions.},

abstract = {Implicit time differencing of the resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations can step over the limiting time scales-such as Alfv{\{}{\'{e}}{\}}n time scales-to resolve the dynamic time scales of interest. However, nonlinearities present in these equations make an implicit implementation cumbersome. Here, viable paths for an implicit, nonlinear time integration of the MHD equations are explored using a 2D reduced viscoresistive MHD model. The implicit time integration is performed using the Newton-Raphson iterative algorithm, employing Krylov iterative techniques for the required algebraic matrix inversions, implemented Jacobian-free (i.e., without ever forming and storing the Jacobian matrix). Convergence in Krylov techniques is accelerated by preconditioning the initial problem. A "physics-based" preconditioner, based on a semi-implicit approximation to the original set of partial differential equations, is employed. The preconditioner employs low-complexity multigrid techniques to invert approximately the resulting elliptic algebraic systems. The resulting 2D reduced resistive MHD implicit algorithm is shown to be successful in dealing with large time steps (on the order of the dynamical time scale of the problem) and fine grids. The algorithm is second-order accurate in time and scalable under grid refinement. Comparison of the implicit CPU time with an explicit integration method demonstrates CPU savings even for moderate (6464) grids, and close to an order of magnitude in fine grids (256256).},

The primary goal of MHD experiments at UCLA using the liquid metal flow facility called MaPLE (Magnetohydrodynamic PbLi Experiment) is to address important MHD effects, heat transfer and flow materials interactions in blanket-relevant conditions. The paper overviews the one-of-a-kind MaPLE loop at UCLA and presents recent experimental activities, including the development and testing of high-temperature PbLi flow diagnostics and experiments that have been performed since the first loop operation in 2011. We also discuss MaPLE upgrades, which need to be done to substantially expand the experimental capabilities towards a new class of MHD flow phenomena that includes buoyancy effects.},

Phys. 87, 1990), with all of the primary dependent variables centered at the same location. To properly represent the divergence-free condition of the magnetic fields, we apply a discrete projection to the intermediate values of the field at cell faces, and apply a filter to the primary dependent variables at the end of each time step. We test the method against a suite of linear and nonlinear tests to ascertain accuracy and stability of the scheme under a variety of conditions. The test suite includes rotated planar linear waves, MHD shock tube problems, low-beta flux tubes, and a magnetized rotor problem. For all of these cases, we observe that the algorithm is second-order accurate for smooth solutions, converges to the correct weak solution for problems involving shocks, and exhibits no evidence of instability or loss of accuracy due to the possible presence of non-solenoidal fields. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Velocity profiles obtained for laminar; and turbulent regimes [Cuevas, S., Picologlou, B. F., Walker, J. S. and Talmage, G., Int. J. Engng Sci, 1997, 35, 485] are employed to solve the heat transfer equation through finite differences, in a duct with one side wall (parallel to the magnetic field) uniformly heated and three adiabatic walls. Turbulent effects are introduced through eddy viscous and thermal diffusivity models from the renormalization group theory of turbulence [Yakhot, V. and Orszag, S. A., J. Sci. Comput., 1986, 1(1), 3]. Analysis focuses in determining how the structure of the side-layer flow, influenced by the wall conductance ratio and Hartmann and Peclet numbers in the ranges of interest of fusion blanket applications, affects the heat transfer processes. Numerical calculations for liquid lithium show that for thin conducting wall duct cases, the laminar MI-ID heat transfer mechanism, characterized by high-velocity side-wall jets, appears to be more efficient than turbulent mixing in the boundary layer for a given Peclet number.

The approach is simple and may be easily applied to both dimensionally split and unsplit Godunov schemes for supersonic MHD flows. The numerical schemes based on the approach are second-order accurate in both space and time if the original Godunov schemes are. As an example of such schemes, a scheme based on the approach and an approximate MHD Riemann solver is presented. The Riemann solver is simple and is used to approximately calculate the time-averaged flux. The correctness, accuracy, and robustness of the scheme are shown through numerical examples. A comparison in numerical solutions between the proposed scheme and a Godunov scheme without the divergence-free constraint implemented is presented.},

abstract = {Magnetic reconnection has a crucial role in a variety of plasma environments in providing a mechanism for the fast release of stored magnetic energy. During reconnection the plasma forms a 'magnetic nozzle', like the nozzle of a hose, and the rate is controlled by how fast plasma can flow out of the nozzle. But the traditional picture of reconnection has been unable to explain satisfactorily the short timescales associated with the energy release, because the flow is mediated by heavy ions with a slow resultant velocity. Recent theoretical work has suggested that the energy release is instead mediated by electrons in waves called 'whistlers', which move much faster for a given perturbation of the magnetic field because of their smaller mass. Moreover, the whistler velocity and associated plasma velocity both increase as the 'nozzle' becomes narrower. A narrower nozzle therefore no longer reduces the total plasma flow-the outflow is independent of the size of the nozzle. Here we report observations demonstrating that reconnection in the magnetosphere is driven by whistlers, in good agreement with the theoretical predictions.},

abstract = {A simple approach to energy conserving boundary conditions using exact symmetries is described which is especially useful for numerical simulations using the finite difference method. Each field in the simulation is normally either symmetric (even) or antisymmetric (odd) with respect to the simulation boundary. Another possible boundary condition is an antisymmetric perturbation about a nonzero value. One of the most powerful aspects of this approach is that it can be easily implemented in curvilinear coordinates by making the scale factors of the coordinate transformation symmetric about the boundaries. The method is demonstrated for magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), reduced MHD, and a hybrid code with particle ions and fluid electrons. These boundary conditions yield exact energy conservation in the limit of infinite time and space resolution. Also discussed is the interpretation that the particle charge reverses sign at a conducting boundary with boundary normal perpendicular to the background magnetic field. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {We present a new numerical implementation of the general-relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations within the Whisky code. The numerical method adopted exploits the properties of implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta numerical schemes to treat the stiff terms that appear in the equations for large electrical conductivities. Using tests in one, two, and three dimensions, we show that our implementation is robust and recovers the ideal-MHD limit in regimes of very high conductivity. Moreover, the results illustrate that the code is capable of describing scenarios in a very wide range of conductivities. In addition to tests in flat spacetime, we report simulations of magnetized nonrotating relativistic stars, both in the Cowling approximation and in dynamical spacetimes. Finally, because of its astrophysical relevance and because it provides a severe tested for general-relativistic codes with dynamical electromagnetic fields, we study the collapse of a nonrotating star to a black hole. We show that also in this case our results on the quasinormal mode frequencies of the excited electromagnetic fields in the Schwarzschild background agree with the perturbative studies within 0.7{\%} and 5.6{\%} for the real and the imaginary part of the ℓ=1 mode eigenfrequency, respectively. Finally we provide an estimate of the electromagnetic efficiency of this process.},

abstract = {The observed surface dynamics of Jupiter and Saturn are dominated by a banded system of fierce zonal winds. The depth of these winds remains unclear but they are thought to be confined to the very outer envelopes where hydrogen remains molecular and the electrical conductivity is small. The dynamo maintaining the dipole-dominated magnetic fields of both gas giants, on the other hand, likely operates in the deeper interior where hydrogen assumes a metallic state.Here, we present numerical simulations that attempt to model both the zonal winds and the interior dynamo action in an integrated approach. Using the anelastic version of the MHD code MagIC, we explore the effects of density stratification and radial electrical conductivity variations. The electrical conductivity is mostly assumed to remain constant in the thicker inner metallic region and it decays exponentially towards the outer boundary throughout the molecular envelope.Our results show that the combination of a stronger density stratification and a weaker conducting outer layer is essential for reconciling dipole dominated dynamo action and a fierce equatorial zonal jet. Previous simulations with homogeneous electrical conductivity show that both are mutually exclusive, with solutions either having strong zonal winds and multipolar magnetic fields or weak zonal winds and dipole-dominated magnetic fields. All jets tend to be geostrophic and therefore reach right through the convective shell in our simulations.The particular setup explored here allows a strong equatorial jet to remain confined to the weaker conducting outer region where it does not interfere with the deeper seated dynamo action. The flanking mid to high latitude jets, on the other hand, have to remain faint to yield a strongly dipolar magnetic field. The fiercer jets on Jupiter and Saturn only seem compatible with the observed dipolar fields when they remain confined to a weaker conducting outer layer. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Unlike most cosmic plasma structures, planetary magnetospheres can be exten- sively studied in situ. In particular, studies of the Earth's magnetosphere over the past few decades have resulted in a relatively good experimental understanding of both its basic struc- tural properties and its response to changes in the impinging solar wind. In this article we provide a broad overview, designed for researchers unfamiliar with magnetospheric physics, of the main processes and parameters that control the structure and dynamics of planetary magnetospheres, especially the Earth's. In particular, we concentrate on the structure and dynamics of three important regions: the bow shock, the magnetopause and the magneto- tail. In the final part of this review we describe the current status of global magnetospheric modelling, which is crucial to placing in situ observations in the proper context and pro- viding a better understanding of magnetospheric structure and dynamics under all possible input conditions. Although the parameter regime experienced in the solar system is limited, the plasma physics that is learned by studying planetary magnetospheres can, in princi- ple, be translated to more general studies of cosmic plasma structures. Conversely, studies of cosmic plasma under a wide range of conditions should be used to understand Earth's magnetosphere under extreme conditions. We conclude the review by discussing this and summarizing some general properties and principles that may be applied to studies of other cosmic plasma structures.},

The induction equation is shown to assume its simplest form when written in terms of the contra-variant forms of velocity and magnetic vector density. The authors describe a new numerical technique, called constrained transport (CT), for evolving the induction equation in a way that maintains vanishing divergence of the poloidal (constrained) field components to within machine round-off error. It is also shown how the 3+1 formalism of numerical relativity can be used to express the general relativistic MHD equations in a form suitable for numerical evolution. The relativistic form of the magnetic induction equation is then shown to fit naturally within the CT scheme. Several models involving magnetized flow near a black hole are used as calibration of the CT scheme.},

abstract = {We describe a new full-vector finite difference discretization, based upon the transverse magnetic field components, for calculating the electromagnetic modes of optical waveguides with transverse, nondiagonal anisotropy. Unlike earlier finite difference approaches, our method allows for the material axes to be arbitrarily oriented, as long as one of the principal axes coincides with the direction of propagation. We demonstrate the capabilities of the method by computing the circularly-polarized modes of a magnetooptical waveguide and the modes of an off-axis poled anisotropic polymer waveguide.},

abstract = {The stability of a periodic magnetic island structure using the ideal magnetohydrodynamic equations has been investigated. An instability is found which describes the tendency toward coalescence of parallel currents in the neighboring islands. It is expected that this instability will proceed at a fast hydromagnetic rate as long as the forces driving the instability can overcome the stabilizing forces due to the compression of the magnetic field between the islands. Beyond that phase, resistivity is expected to dominate the tendency toward island coalescence. Island coalescence of this kind can explain why in the observation of tearing mode instabilities in tokamaks, only the modes with minimum values of m and n are seen.},

The relaxation event begins$\backslash$nwith a dominant n=1 kink mode responsible for poloidal flux amplification$\backslash$nand ends with a low activity period (of several tens of Alfve{\&}acute;n$\backslash$ntimes) which produces a current redistribution process that flattens$\backslash$nthe {\&}lambda; profile.

Near the vertical wall the flow is depicted in the form of a confined jet whose thickness determines the instability onset in a rotating magnetic field. It was shown that the critical Reynolds number can be found by using the jet velocity Uo for Rec=u{\~{}}/vt3u/{\&}. The effect of frequency of a magnetic field on the fluid flow was also studied.

Stabilized finite elements techniques and an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation (for the motion of the interface separating the two fluids) are used in the numerical simulation. With a view to justifying our strategy, details on the numerical analysis of the problem, with a special emphasis on conservation and stability properties and on the surface tension discretization, as well as results on tests cases are provided.

abstract = {We present the first three-dimensional (3D), time-dependent, self-consistent numerical solution of the magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) equations that describe thermal convection and magnetic field generation in a rapidly rotating spherical fluid shell with a solid conducting inner core. This solution, which serves as a crude analog for the geodynamo, is a self-sustaining supercritical dynamo that has maintained a magnetic field for three magnetic diffusion times, roughly 40 000 years. Fluid velocity in the outer core reaches a maximum of 0.4 cm s-1, and at times the magnetic field can be as large as 560 gauss. Magnetic energy is usually about 4000 times greater than the kinetic energy of the convection that maintains it. Viscous and magnetic coupling to both the inner core below and the mantle above cause time-dependent variations in their respective rotation rates; the inner core usually rotates faster than the mantle and decadal variations in the length of the day of the mantle are similar to those observed for the Earth. The pattern and amplitude of the radial magnetic field at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) and its secular variation are also similar to the Earth's. The maximum amplitudes of the longitudinally averaged temperature gradient, shear flow, helicity, and magnetic field oscillate between the northern and southern hemispheres on a time scale of a few thousand years. However, only once in many attempts does the field succeed in reversing its polarity because the field in the inner core, which has the opposite polarity to the field in most of the outer core, usually does not have enough time to reverse before the field in the outer core changes again. One successful magnetic field reversal occurs near the end of our simulation. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {The first results of an axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model of the interaction of an expanding cometary atmosphere with the solar wind are presented. The model assumes that far upstream the plasma flow lines are parallel to the magnetic field vector. The effects of mass loading and ion-neutral friction are taken into account by the governing equations, whcih are solved on an adaptively refined unstructured grid using a Monotone Upstream Centered Schemes for Conservative Laws (MUSCL)-type numerical technique. The combination of the adaptive refinement with the MUSCL-scheme allows the entire cometary atmosphere to be modeled, while still resolving both the shock and the near nucleus of the comet. The main findingsare the following: (1) A shock is formed approximately = 0.45 Mkm upstream of the comet (its location is controlled by the sonic and Alfvenic Mach numbers of the ambient solar wind flow and by the cometary mass addition rate). (2) A contact surface is formed approximately = 5,600 km upstream of the nucleus separating an outward expanding cometary ionosphere from the nearly stagnating solar wind flow. The location of the contact surface is controlled by the upstream flow conditions, the mass loading rate and the ion-neutral drag. The contact surface is also the boundary of the diamagnetic cavity. (3) A closed inner shock terminates the supersonic expansion of the cometary ionosphere. This inner shock is closer to the nucleus on dayside than on the nightside.},

abstract = {The transition from liquid metal to silicate rock in the cores of the terrestrial planets is likely to be accompanied by a gradient in the composition of the outer core liquid. The electrical conductivity of a volatile-enriched liquid alloy can be substantially lower than a light-element-depleted fluid found close to the inner core boundary. In this paper, we investigate the effect of radially variable electrical conductivity on planetary dynamo action using an electrical conductivity that decreases exponentially as a function of radius. We find that numerical solutions with continuous, radially outward decreasing electrical conductivity profiles result in strongly modified flow and magnetic field dynamics, compared to solutions with homogeneous electrical conductivity. The force balances at the top of the simulated fluid determine the overall character of the flow. The relationship between Coriolis, and Lorentz forces near the outer core boundary controls the flow and magnetic field intensity and morphology of the system. Our results imply that a low conductivity layer near the top of Mercury's liquid outer core is consistent with its weak magnetic field. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The originality of the approach is that no artificial boundary condition is enforced at the interface between the conducting and the insulating regions and the non-conducting medium is not approximated by a weakly conducting medium as is frequently done in the literature. As a first evaluation of the performance of the method, we study two-dimensional (2D) configurations, where the flow streamlines of the conducting fluid are planar, i.e., invariant in one direction, and either the magnetic field ("magnetic scalar" case) or the electric field ("electric scalar" case) is parallel to the invariant direction.

abstract = {We consider solving three-dimensional electromagnetic problems in parameter regimes where the quasi-static approximation applies and the permeability, permittivity, and conductivity may vary significantly. The difficulties encountered include handling solution discontinuities across interfaces and accelerating convergence of traditional iterative methods for the solution of the linear systems of algebraic equations that arise when discretizing Maxwell's equations in the frequency domain. The present article extends methods we proposed earlier for constant permeability [E. Haber, U. Ascher, D. Aruliah, and D. Oldenburg, J. Comput. Phys., 163 (2000), pp. 150–171; D. Aruliah, U. Ascher, E. Haber, and D. Oldenburg, Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci., to appear.] to handle also problems in which the permeability is variable and may contain significant jump discontinuities. In order to address the problem of slow convergence we reformulate Maxwell's equations in terms of potentials, applying a Helmholtz decomposition to either the electric field or the magnetic field. The null space of the curl operators can then be annihilated by adding a stabilizing term, using a gauge condition, and thus obtaining a strongly elliptic differential operator. A staggered grid finite volume discretization is subsequently applied to the reformulated PDE system. This scheme works well for sources of various types, even in the presence of strong material discontinuities in both conductivity and permeability. The resulting discrete system is amenable to fast convergence of ILU-preconditioned Krylov methods. We test our method using several numerical examples and demonstrate its robust efficiency. We also compare it to the classical Yee method using similar iterative techniques for the resulting algebraic system, and we show that our method is significantly faster, especially for electric sources.},

We use a potential-current formulation (A, phi, (J) over circle) with a Coulomb gauge. The potentials A and phi decompose the electric field E into components in the active and null spaces of the del x operator. We develop a finite volume discretization on a staggered grid that naturally employs harmonic averages for the conductivity at cell faces. After discretization, we eliminate the current and the resulting large, sparse, linear system of equations has a block structure that is diagonally dominant, allowing an efficient solution with preconditioned Krylov space methods. A particularly efficient algorithm results from the combination of BICGSTAB and an incomplete LU-decomposition. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in several numerical experiments.

ELM mitigation using liquid Li surface and neon gas puffing are also simulated. Initial results indicate that a thin layer of Li ({\textless}1 mm) can fully protect the divertor surface from giant ELMs. Significant amount of neon gas puff (nL {\textgreater} 1017 cm-2) is needed to prevent tungsten surface from melting during giant ELMs. Vapor impurity diffusion through the private flux region can be major source of plasma contamination during ELMs and could terminate the plasma in a disruption. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The deposited plasma energy during major disruptions, edge-localized modes (ELMs), and vertical displacement events (VDEs) causes significant surface erosion, possible structural failure, and frequent plasma contamination. Surface damage consists of vaporization, spallation, and liquid splatter of metallic materials. Structural damage includes large temperature increases and high thermal stresses in structural materials and at the interfaces between surface coatings and structural members. To evaluate the lifetimes of plasma-facing materials and nearby components and to predict the various forms of damage that they experience, comprehensive models (contained in the heights computer simulation package) are developed, integrated self-consistently, and enhanced. Splashing mechanisms such as bubble boiling and various liquid magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities and brittle destruction mechanisms of nonmelting materials can be serious erosion mechanisms and are being studied in detail. The ejected macroscopic particles (MPs) will interact with incoming plasma particles and with the vapor cloud above the surface. Therefore, the dynamic behavior of MPs in the vapor cloud and their influence on total erosion rate is important. Results of self-consistent MHD calculations are presented in which the dynamics of both the vapor cloud and MP interaction are coupled with incoming plasma ions and electrons from the scrape-off layer during a disruption. The design requirements and implications of plasma facing and nearby components are discussed, along with recommendations to mitigate and reduce the effects of plasma instabilities on reactor components.

abstract = {The 11-year solar magnetic cycle shows a high degree of coherence in spite of the turbulent nature of the solar convection zone. It has been found in recent high-resolution magnetohydrodynamics simulations that the maintenance of a large-scale coherent magnetic field is difficult with small viscosity and magnetic diffusivity (≲10 (12) square centimenters per second). We reproduced previous findings that indicate a reduction of the energy in the large-scale magnetic field for lower diffusivities and demonstrate the recovery of the global-scale magnetic field using unprecedentedly high resolution. We found an efficient small-scale dynamo that suppresses small-scale flows, which mimics the properties of large diffusivity. As a result, the global-scale magnetic field is maintained even in the regime of small diffusivities-that is, large Reynolds numbers.},

@article{Wu1984,
abstract = {A full-implicit-continuous-Eulerian (FICE) scheme is developed for solving multidimensional transient magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow problems. The resulting difference equations are solved through a single-loop iteration in which the time-advanced pressure equation is solved by using the line-by-line iteration method (Patankar, "Numerical Heat Flow," Hemisphere, Washington, D.C., 1980). In order to keep the boundary conditions self-consistent, a new formulation of boundary conditions is developed for this two-dimensional initial boundary value magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow problem. The merit of this new formulation is that improved consistency and accuracy on both physical and computational boundary values are obtained when compared to earlier methods. The stipulation of the boundary conditions is based on the projected characteristic method. The boundaries in a numerical computation may be classified into the following two categories: (i) Physical boundaries, on which the number of dependent variables are to be arbitrarily specified, would be limited to the number of incoming characteristics that are projected in the n - t plane, where n is the unit normal of the boundary in question and t is time. The rest of the variables (if any) should satisfy the compatibility equations along the outgoing projected characteristics in the n - t plane. (ii) Computational boundaries, on which a related set of compatibility equations should also be satisfied. In addition, a new nonreflecting boundary condition is introduced by taking all the spatial derivative terms of dependent variables to be zero in the characteristic equations along the incoming projected characteristics in the n - t plane. A numerical example for an astrophysical fluid is given to illustrate the present algorithm and boundary conditions. In addition, the comparison between the results of using the present nonreflecting boundary condition and the two conventional ones (i.e., equivalue and linear extrapolations) is made. It shows that the nonreflecting boundary condition formulated in this paper gives much smaller (almost null) reflection after the disturbance has reached the boundary and, therefore, can provide more accurate numerical results. ?? 1984.},

The interaction parameter and Hartmann number are assumed to be large, whereas the magnetic Reynolds number is assumed to be small. General solutions for the inviscid inertialess core of the flow and the viscous inertialess Hartmann layer are matched at the core/Hartmann layer interface. This matching provides sufficient conditions for obtaining a unique solution. The numerical scheme used in the solution is discussed and results for the case of a fringing magnetic field are presented. The numerical scheme employs an approximate treatment for the side region containing the singularity at the point where the magnetic field lines are tangential to the inner surface of the duct. This approximation is shown to be appropriate for MHD flows under fusion reactor relevant conditions. ?? 1989.},

abstract = {This paper examines the three-dimensional liquid metal MHD flow in rectangular ducts with thin conducting walls and with an inclined non-uniform transverse magnetic field. The Hartmann number and interaction parameter are assumed to be large and the magnetic Reynolds number is assumed to be small. Under these assumptions, viscous and inertial effects are confined to thin boundary layers adjacent to the walls. Outside these layers, the governing equations are significantly simplified. For validation of the numerical solutions, exact analytical solutions are derived for the case of a rectangular duct of equal wall thickness and with a uniform magnetic field. Comparisons of the exact analytical and numerical solutions give excellent agreement. Variation of the fully developed flow pressure gradient with the wall conductance ratio, aspect ratio, and magnetic angle is discussed. Numerical solutions are presented for flow in the varying field region where the flow is perturbed due to three-dimensional effects. The three-dimensional pressure drop, i.e. in excess of the locally fully developed pressure, is presented and its implication to a fusion blanket is discussed. The velocity distributions are also presented. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {The MHD flow driven by a travelling magnetic field (TMF) in an annular channel is investigated numerically. For sufficiently large magnetic Reynolds number Rm, or if a large enough pressure gradient is externally applied, the system undergoes an instability in which the flow rate in the channel dramatically drops from synchronism with the wave to much smaller velocities. This transition takes the form of a saddle-node bifurcation for the time-averaged quantities. In this first paper, we characterize the bifurcation, and study the stability of the flow as a function of several parameters. We show that the bifurcation of the flow involves a bistability between Poiseuille-like and Hartman-like regimes, and relies on magnetic flux expulsion. Based on this observation, new predictions are made for the occurrence of this stalling instability.},

abstract = {For cooling of the first wall and blanket in a magnetic confinement fusion reactor, the use of a helium-lithium annular-mist flow is proposed to mitigate the effects of a strong magnetic field on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) pressure drop and the deterioration of heat transfer due to laminarization. In annular-mist flow, the magnetic field has mainly an effect on film flow of liquid lithium near the wall region. Instead of the helium-lithium annular-mist flow at high temperature, an air-mercury stratified flow in a horizontal rectangular duct in a vertical magnetic field was investigated to get more detailed information on the characteristics of interfacial waves, MHD pressure drop, and heat transfer. Below 0.4 tesla, when the magnetic flux density increases, the pressure drop decreases due to laminarization of mercury flow and damping of the interfacial waves. However, it increases above 0.5 T due to both the Hartmann flow effect and the increment in the mercury layer thickness. A new correlation was obtained for pressure drop multipliers in two-phase MHD flow. As the magnetic flux density increases, the heat transfer coefficient decreases monotonously and becomes about half of its initial value in the high magnetic flux density. However, when the gas Reynolds number is increased, the heat transfer deterioration is suppressed until the magnetic flux density becomes high enough. Criteria of Nusselt number deterioration under a magnetic field were obtained in various flow conditions. A computational analysis using the k-?? turbulence model including magnetic effect terms was tried and compared with the experimental values of temperature profiles and heat transfer coefficients. The computational results agreed well with the experimental values in the condition with negligible interfacial waves.},

abstract = {Simulations of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows in bounded domains using spectral methods suffer from a number of serious limitations. Alternative methods based on local discretization raise the problem of how to implement non-local boundary conditions for the magnetic field. We have developed a new strategy for the numerical solution of MHD problems in bounded domains, which combines the flexibility of a local discretization with a rigorous formulation of magnetic boundary conditions next to an insulator in arbitrary geometries. In accordance with the character of underlying equations we apply a global integral approach at the boundary and a differential approach inside the conducting domain. The formulation of the boundary problem in terms of primitive variables allows us to combine these approaches and propose a mixed finite volume and boundary element method. We illustrate its efficiency on magnetic diffusion problems in a sphere and in a finite cylinder. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {It is frequently considered that many planetary magnetic fields originate as a result of convection within planetary cores. Buoyancy forces responsible for driving the convection generate a fluid flow that is able to induce magnetic fields; numerous sophisticated computer codes are able to simulate the dynamic behaviour of such systems. This paper reports the results of a community activity aimed at comparing numerical results of several different types of computer codes that are capable of solving the equations of momentum transfer, magnetic field generation and heat transfer in the setting of a spherical shell, namely a sphere containing an inner core. The electrically conducting fluid is incompressible and rapidly rotating and the forcing of the flow is thermal convection under the Boussinesq approximation. We follow the original specifications and results reported in Harder {\&} Hansen to construct a specific benchmark in which the boundaries of the fluid are taken to be impenetrable, non-slip and isothermal, with the added boundary condition for the magnetic field B that the field must be entirely radial there; this type of boundary condition for B is frequently referred to as pseudo-vacuum'. This latter condition should be compared with the more frequently used insulating boundary condition. This benchmark is so-defined in order that computer codes based on local methods, such as finite element, finite volume or finite differences, can handle the boundary condition with ease. The defined benchmark, governed by specific choices of the Roberts, magnetic Rossby, Rayleigh and Ekman numbers, possesses a simple solution that is steady in an azimuthally drifting frame of reference, thus allowing easy comparison among results. Results from a variety of types of code are reported, including codes that are fully spectral (based on spherical harmonic expansions in angular coordinates and polynomial expansions in radius), mixed spectral and finite difference, finite volume, finite element and also a mixed Fourier-finite element code. There is good agreement among codes.},

abstract = {Relativistic hydro and magnetohydrodynamics provide continuum fluid descriptions for gas and plasma dynamics throughout the visible universe. We present an overview of state-of-the-art modeling in special relativistic regimes, targeting strong shock-dominated flows with speeds approaching the speed of light. Significant progress in its numerical modeling emerged in the last two decades, and we highlight specifically the need for grid-adaptive, shock-capturing treatments found in several contemporary codes in active use and development. Our discussion highlights one such code, MPI-AMRVAC (Message-Passing Interface-Adaptive Mesh Refinement Versatile Advection Code), but includes generic strategies for allowing massively parallel, block-tree adaptive simulations in any dimensionality. We provide implementation details reflecting the underlying data structures as used in MPI-AMRVAC. Parallelization strategies and scaling efficiencies are discussed for representative applications, along with guidelines for data formats suitable for parallel I/O. Refinement strategies available in MPI-AMRVAC are presented, which cover error estimators in use in many modern AMR frameworks. A test suite for relativistic hydro and magnetohydrodynamics is provided, chosen to cover all aspects encountered in high-resolution, shock-governed astrophysical applications. This test suite provides ample examples highlighting the advantages of AMR in relativistic flow problems. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

The effect of various wall conductivity configurations on the heat transfer capability and pressure gradient requirements is also investigated. The three momentum, three induction, pressure and energy equations are cast in parabolic form and integrated numerically by the use of a marching procedure in the stream direction. Mesh size limitations restrict the flow to low Hartmann numbers. The results show a smooth and rapid development of the flow over a length which is sensitive to the Hartmann number. Velocity and temperature profiles are flattened and heat transfer coefficients are increased. The calculations for mixed wall conductivities show that it is possible to increase heat transfer capabilities of the flow significantly by selectively insulating the corners of the ducts. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

The pressure and Cartesian velocity components are defined at the center of each cell, while the face-normal velocities are defined at the mid-points of the corresponding cell faces. A second-order fully implicit time-advancement scheme is used for time integration and the resulting nonlinear equations are linearized without losing the overall time accuracy. Both the momentum and Poisson equations are integrated with the finite volume method and the flow variables at the cell face are obtained using an interpolation scheme independent of cell shape.

Two regimes of instability and transition of Hunt's jets at the walls parallel to the magnetic field have been identified. The first one occurs for relatively low values of the Reynolds number Re and is associated with weak, periodic, counterrotating vortices discovered previously in linear stability studies. The second is a new regime taking place for higher values of Re. It is associated with trains of small-scale vortices enveloped into larger structures, and involves partial detachment of jets from parallel walls. Once this regime sets in, the kinetic energy of perturbations increases by 2 orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {A review of experimental work on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and heat transfer (HT) characteristics of liquid metal flows in fusion relevant conditions is presented. Experimental data on MHD flow pressure drop in straight channels of round and rectangular cross-section with electroconducting walls in a transverse magnetic field show good agreement with theoretical predictions, and simple engineering formulas are confirmed. Less data are available on velocity distribution and HT characteristics, and even less data are available for channels with electroinsulating walls or artificially made self-healing electroinsulating coatings. Some experiments show an interesting phenomena of HT increase in the presence of a transverse or axial magnetic field. For channels of complex geometry - expansions, contractions, bends, and manifolds - few experimental data are available. Future efforts should be directed toward investigation of MHD/HT in straight channels with perfect and nonperfect electroinsulated walls, including walls with controlled imperfections, and in channels of complex geometry. International cooperation in manufacturing and operating experimental facilities with magnetic fields at, or even higher than, 5-7 T with comparatively large volumes may be of great help. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

The fluctuating$\backslash$ncomponent of the magnetic field in such a flow can in principle be$\backslash$ndissipated by magnetic reconnection and used to accelerate the flow. We$\backslash$ninvestigate how rapidly this transition can take place by implementing$\backslash$ninto a global MHD model that uses a thermodynamic description of$\backslash$nthe plasma, explicit, physically motivated prescriptions for the$\backslash$ndissipation rate: a lower limit on this rate is given by limiting the$\backslash$nmaximum drift speed of the current carriers to that of light, an upper$\backslash$nlimit follows from demanding that the dissipation zone expand only$\backslash$nsubsonically in the comoving frame, and a further prescription is$\backslash$nobtained by assuming that the expansion speed is limited by the growth$\backslash$nrate of the relativistic tearing mode. In each case, solutions are$\backslash$npresented that give the Lorentz factor of a spherical wind containing a$\backslash$ntransverse, oscillating magnetic field component as a function of$\backslash$nradius.

abstract = {We characterize experimentally how three dimensionality appears in wall-bounded magnetohydrodynamic flows. Our analysis of the breakdown of a square array of vortices in a cubic container singles out two mechanisms: first, a form of three dimensionality we call weak appears through differential rotation in individual 2D vortices. Second, strong three dimensionality characterized by vortex disruption leads on the one hand to a remarkable vortex array that is both steady and 3D, and, on the other hand, to scale-selective breakdown of two dimensionality in chaotic flows. Most importantly, these phenomena are entirely driven by inertia, so they are relevant to other flows with a tendency to two dimensionality, such as rotating, or stratified flows in geophysics and astrophysics.},

abstract = {We consider the case of homogeneous turbulence in a conducting fluid that is exposed to a uniform external magnetic field at low to moderate magnetic Reynolds numbers (by moderate we mean here values as high as 20). When the magnetic Reynolds number is vanishingly small (Rm ≪ 1), it is customary to simplify the governing magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations using what is known as the quasi-static (QS) approximation. As the magnetic Reynolds number is increased, a progressive transition between the physics described by the QS approximation and the MHD equations occurs. We show here that this intermediate regime can be described by another approximation which we call the quasi-linear (QL) approximation. For the numerical simulations performed, the predictions of the QL approximation are in good agreement with those of MHD for magnetic Reynolds number up to Rm ∼20. {\textcopyright} 2004 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {This article reviews the main established ideas on the influence of a magnetic field on turbulence in electrically conducting fluids. We limit our discussion to the asymptotic range of very small values of the magnetic Reynolds number, characterized by the fact that the induced magnetic field remains very small in comparison with the applied magnetic field. We consider three kinds of flows here. The simplest one is freely decaying homogeneous turbulence, which serves as a test bed to analyze the development of anisotropy resulting from the linear damping by the Lorentz force. We then discuss flows between walls perpendicular to the magnetic field and emphasize the influence of the Hartmann layers that develop in their vicinity. We then review the main features of the possible quasi-two-dimensional regime that can arise in that context. Finally, we consider magnetohydrodynamic turbulent shear flows. These are frequent in industrial applications involving molten metals, such as in metal processing or in the blanket of future nuclear fusion reactors. We pay particular attention to recent attempts to develop specific RANS (Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes) models for these flows.},

abstract = {Two approaches to finite difference approximation of turbulent flows of electrically conducting incompressible fluids in the presence of a steady magnetic field are analyzed. One is based on high-order approximations and upwind-biased discretization of the nonlinear term. Another is consistently of the second order and nearly fully conservative in regard of mass, momentum, kinetic energy, and electric charge conservation principles. The analysis is conducted using comparison with high-accuracy spectral direct numerical simulations of channel flows with wall-normal and spanwise magnetic fields. Focus of the analysis is on the quality of finite difference approximation in the situation when the magnetic field leads to significant transformation of the flow structure. In the case of turbulent flows at moderate magnetic fields, the conservative scheme approach offers better stability and equal or higher accuracy than the approach based on the upwind discretization. The conservation property is expected to become increasingly important and even indispensable at stronger magnetic fields. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

We also examine the inertial range dynamics in terms of the ratios of kinetic to magnetic energy, and of the turn-over time to the Alfv$\backslash$'en time, and analyze the temporal variations of these quasi-equilibria.},

Due to their symmetry of excitation, these devices tend to have quite uniform etch rates across the wafer. However, side to side and azimuthal variations in these rates have been observed, and have been attributed to various asymmetries in pumping, reactor structure and coil properties. In this article, a three-dimensional computer model for an ICP etching reactor is reported whose purposes is to investigate these asymmetries. The model system is an ICP reactor powered at 13.56 MHz having flat coils of nested annuli powering Ar/N2 and Cl2 plasmas over a 20-cm diam wafer. For demonstration purposes, asymmetries were built into the reactor geometry which include a wafer-load lock bay, wafer clamps, electrical feeds to the coil, and specifics of the coil design. Comparisons are made between computed and experimentally measured ion densities and poly-silicon etch rates in Cl2 plasmas. We find that the electrical transmission line properties of the coil have a large influence on the uniformity of plasma generation and ion fluxes to the wafer.},

abstract = {We introduce an unsplit staggered mesh scheme (USM) for multidimensional magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) that uses a constrained transport (CT) method with high-order Godunov fluxes and incorporates a new data reconstruction-evolution algorithm for second-order MHD interface states. In this new algorithm, the USM scheme includes so-called "multidimensional MHD terms", proportional to ??? ?? B, in a dimensionally-unsplit way in a single update. This data reconstruction-evolution step, extended from the corner transport upwind (CTU) approach of Colella, maintains in-plane dynamics very well, as shown by the advection of a very weak magnetic field loop in 2D. This data reconstruction-evolution algorithm is also of advantage in its consistency and simplicity when extended to 3D. The scheme maintains the ??? ?? B = 0 constraint by solving a set of discrete induction equations using the standard CT approach, where the accuracy of the computed electric field directly influences the quality of the magnetic field solution. We address the lack of proper dissipative behavior in the simple electric field averaging scheme and present a new modified electric field construction (MEC) that includes multidimensional derivative information and enhances solution accuracy. A series of comparison studies demonstrates the excellent performance of the full USM-MEC scheme for many stringent multidimensional MHD test problems chosen from the literature.

@article{VanLeer1997,
abstract = {A method of second-order accuracy is described for integrating the equations of ideal compressible flow. The method is based on the integral conservation laws and is dissipative, so that it can be used across shocks. The heart of the method is a one-dimensional Lagrangean scheme that may be regarded as a second-order sequel to Godunov's method. The second-order accuracy is achieved by taking the distributions of the state quantities inside a gas slab to be linear, rather than uniform as in Godunov's method. The Lagrangean results are remapped with least-squares accuracy onto the desired Euler grid in a separate step. Several monotonicity algorithms are applied to ensure positivity, monotonicity, and nonlinear stability. Higher dimensions are covered through time splitting. Numerical results for one-dimensional and two-dimensional flows are presented, demonstrating the efficiency of the method. The paper concludes with a summary of the results of the whole series “Towards the Ultimate Conservative Difference Scheme.”},

abstract = {Experiments and three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulations are performed to investigate the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) characteristics of liquid metal (LM) flows of molten lead-lithium (PbLi) eutectic alloy in an electrically conducting circular duct subjected to a transverse non-uniform (fringing) magnetic field. An indirect measurement approach for differential pressure in high temperature LM PbLi is first developed, and then detailed data on pressure drop in this PbLi MHD flow are measured. The obtained experimental results for the pressure distribution are in good agreement with numerical simulations. Using the numerical simulation results, the 3D effects caused by fringing magnetic field on the LM flow are illustrated via distributions for the axial pressure gradients and transverse pressure differences. It has been verified that a simple approach for estimation of pressure drop in LM MHD flow in a fringing magnetic field proposed by Miyazaki et al. [22] i.e., a simple integral of pressure gradient along the fringing field zone using a quasi-fully- developed flow assumption, is also applicable to the conditions of the present experiment providing the magnetic interaction parameter is large enough. Furthermore, for two different sections of the LM flow at the entry to and at the exit from the magnet, it is found that the pressure distributions in the duct cross sections in these two regions are different. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Comput. Phys. 227 (2008) 7368-7393] to the fourth-order. Central finite-volume schemes on overlapping grid are used for both the volume-averaged variables and the face-averaged magnetic field. The magnetic field at the cell boundaries falls within the dual grid and is naturally continuous so that our method eliminates the instability triggered by the discontinuity in the normal component of the magnetic field. Our fourth-order scheme has much smaller numerical dissipation than the third-order scheme. The divergence-free condition of the magnetic field is preserved by our fourth-order divergence-free reconstruction and the constrained transport method. Numerical examples show that the divergence-free condition is essential to the accuracy of the method when a limiter is used in the reconstruction. The high-order, low-dissipation, and divergence-free properties of this method make it an ideal tool for direct magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence simulations. ?? 2010.},

abstract = {We present a general framework to design Godunov-type schemes for multidimensional ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) systems, having the divergence-free relation and the related properties of the magnetic field B as built-in conditions. Our approach mostly relies on the constrained transport (CT) discretization technique for the magnetic field components, originally developed for the linear induction equation, which assures [??? ?? B]num = 0 and its preservation in time to within machine accuracy in a finite-volume setting. We show that the CT formalism, when fully exploited, can be used as a general guideline to design the reconstruction procedures of the B vector field, to adapt standard upwind procedures for the momentum and energy equations, avoiding the onset of numerical monopoles of O(1) size, and to formulate approximate Riemann solvers for the induction equation. This general framework will be named here upwind constrained transport (UCT). To demonstrate the versatility of our method, we apply it to a variety of schemes, which are finally validated numerically and compared: a novel implementation for the MHD case of the second-order Roe-type positive scheme by Liu and Lax [J. Comput. Fluid Dyn. 5 (1996) 133], and both the second- and third-order versions of a central-type MHD scheme presented by Londrillo and Del Zanna [Astrophys.

abstract = {We consider dynamics and turbulent interaction of whistler modes within the framework of inertialess electron magnetohydrodynamics (EMHD). We argue that there is no energy principle in EMHD: any stationary closed configuration is neutrally stable. On the other hand, the relaxation principle, the long term evolution of a weakly dissipative system towards Taylor-Beltrami state, remains valid in EMHD. We consider the turbulent cascade of whistler modes. We show that (i) harmonic whistlers are exact nonlinear solutions; (ii) collinear whistlers do not interact (including counterpropagating); (iii) waves with the same value of the wave vector k1=k2 do not interact; (iv) whistler modes have a dispersion that allows a three-wave decay, including into a zero frequency mode; (v) the three-wave interaction effectively couples modes with highly different wave numbers and propagation angles. In addition, linear interaction of a whistler with a single zero mode can lead to spatially divergent structures via parametric instability. All these properties are drastically different from MHD, so that the qualitative properties of the Alfv{\'{e}}n turbulence can not be transferred to the EMHD turbulence. We derive the Hamiltonian formulation of EMHD, and using Bogoliubov transformation reduce it to the canonical form; we calculate the matrix elements for the three-wave interaction of whistlers. We solve numerically the kinetic equation and show that, generally, the EMHD cascade develops within a broad range of angles, while transiently it may show anisotropic, nearly two-dimensional structures. Development of a cascade depends on the forcing (nonuniversal) and often fails to reach a steady state. Analytical estimates predict the spectrum of magnetic fluctuations for the quasi-isotropic cascade ∝k−2. The cascade remains weak (not critically balanced). The cascade is UV local, while the infrared locality is weakly (logarithmically) violated.},

abstract = {Numerical simulations including magnetic fields have become important in many fields of astrophysics. Evolution of magnetic fields by the constrained transport algorithm preserves magnetic divergence to machine precision, and thus represents one preferred method for the inclusion of magnetic fields in simulations. We show that constrained transport can be implemented with volume-centered fields and hyperresistivity on a high-order finite difference stencil. Additionally, the finite-difference coefficients can be tuned to enhance high-wavenumber resolution. Similar techniques can be used for the interpolations required for dealiasing corrections at high wavenumber. Together, these measures yield an algorithm with a wavenumber resolution that approaches the theoretical maximum achieved by spectral algorithms. Because this algorithm uses finite differences instead of fast Fourier transforms, it runs faster and isn't restricted to periodic boundary conditions. Also, since the finite differences are spatially local, this algorithm is easily scalable to thousands of processors. We demonstrate that, for low-Mach-number turbulence, the results agree well with a high-order, non-constrained-transport scheme with Poisson divergence cleaning.},

For two-dimensional flows, used for the study of large-scale motions in the atmosphere or ocean, enstrophy is cascaded to high wave numbers and dissipated at a finite rate even at infinite Re.

These dynamically stable configurations take the form of magnetic tori, with linked poloidal and toroidal fields, that slowly rise towards the stellar surface. This paper studies a simple analytical model of such a torus, designed to elucidate the physical processes that govern its evolution. It is found that one-dimensional numerical calculations reproduce some key features of the numerical simulations, with radiative heat transfer, Archimedes' principle, Lorentz force and Ohmic decay all playing significant roles.},

abstract = {We obtain lower limits on the amplitude of convective velocities in the deep solar convection zone (CZ) based only on the observed properties of the differential rotation and meridional circulation together with simple and robust dynamical balances obtained from the fundamental magnetohydrodynamics equations. The linchpin of the approach is the concept of gyroscopic pumping whereby the meridional circulation across isosurfaces of specific angular momentum is linked to the angular momentum transport by the convective Reynolds stress. We find that the amplitude of the convective velocity must be at least 30 m s–1 in the upper CZ (r {\~{}} 0.95R) and at least 8 m s–1 in the lower CZ (r {\~{}} 0.75R) in order to be consistent with the observed mean flows. Using the base of the near-surface shear layer as a probe of the rotational influence, we are further able to show that the characteristic length scale of deep convective motions must be no smaller than 5.5-30 Mm. These results are compatible with convection models but suggest that the efficiency of the turbulent transport assumed in advection-dominated flux-transport dynamo models is generally not consistent with the mean flows they employ.},

abstract = {We present a description of the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) implementation of the PLUTO code for solving the equations of classical and special relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD and RMHD). The current release exploits, in addition to the static grid version of the code, the distributed infrastructure of the CHOMBO library for multidimensional parallel computations over block-structured, adaptively refined grids. We employ a conservative finite-volume approach where primary flow quantities are discretized at the cell center in a dimensionally unsplit fashion using the Corner Transport Upwind method. Time stepping relies on a characteristic tracing step where piecewise parabolic method, weighted essentially non-oscillatory, or slope-limited linear interpolation schemes can be handily adopted. A characteristic decomposition-free version of the scheme is also illustrated. The solenoidal condition of the magnetic field is enforced by augmenting the equations with a generalized Lagrange multiplier providing propagation and damping of divergence errors through a mixed hyperbolic/parabolic explicit cleaning step. Among the novel features, we describe an extension of the scheme to include non-ideal dissipative processes, such as viscosity, resistivity, and anisotropic thermal conduction without operator splitting. Finally, we illustrate an efficient treatment of point-local, potentially stiff source terms over hierarchical nested grids by taking advantage of the adaptivity in time. Several multidimensional benchmarks and applications to problems of astrophysical relevance assess the potentiality of the AMR version of PLUTO in resolving flow features separated by large spatial and temporal disparities.},

When both ensemble and time averaged, an inverse energy cascade behavior is observed, even in the absence of external mechanical forcing: The energy spectrum at scales larger than the characteristic scale of the flow follows a k−5/3 law, with negative flux, together with a k−3 law at smaller scales, and a positive flux of enstrophy.

It is assumed that the magnetic Reynolds number Rm = u0l{\&}sol;{\&}lambda; (where u0 is the root-mean-square velocity and {\&}lambda; the magnetic diffusivity) is small. It is shown that to lowest order in the small quantities l{\&}sol;L and Rm, isotropic turbulence has no effect on the large-scale field; but that turbulence that lacks reflexional symmetry is capable of amplifying Fourier components of the field on length scales of order Rm{\&}minus;2l and greater. In the case of turbulence whose statistical properties are invariant under rotation of the axes of reference, but not under reflexions in a point, it is shown that the magnetic energy density of a magnetic field which is initially a homogeneous random function of position with a particularly simple spectrum ultimately increases as t{\&}minus;{\&}half;exp ({\&}alpha;2t{\&}sol;2{\&}lambda;3) where {\&}alpha;(= O(u02l)) is a certain linear functional of the spectrum tensor of the turbulence.

Such flows are responsible for the generation of large-scale magnetic fields which themselves exhibit magnetic helicity. In the geophysical context, the turbulence has a ‘magnetostrophic' character in which the force balance is primarily that between buoyancy forces, Coriolis forces and Lorentz forces associated with the dynamo-generated magnetic field; the dominant nonlinearity here arises from the convective transport of buoyant elements erupting from the ‘mushy zone' at the inner core boundary. At the opposite extreme, in a highly conducting low-density plasma, the near-invariance of magnetic field topology (and of associated helicity) presents the challenging problem of ‘magnetic relaxation under topological constraints', of central importance both in astrophysical contexts and in controlled-fusion plasma dynamics. These problems are reviewed and open issues, particularly concerning saturation mechanisms, are reconsidered.},

abstract = {The dual-coolant lead-lithium, or DCLL, blanket concept is of strong interest in the US fusion technology program. In the DCLL blanket, the flow channel insert (FCI) is a critical component. FCIs must have low electrical and thermal conductivity and be compatible with lead-lithium eutectic alloy (Pb-17Li) at elevated temperatures. FCIs must retain structural integrity and desirable properties even under irradiation and large temperature gradients during operation. FCIs must not fail in such a way that Pb-17Li enters the FCI and changes its electrical or thermal conductivity significantly. Another important issue for the DCLL is the development of a suitable tritium extraction from the Pb-17Li to achieve low tritium partial pressure, thus facilitating decisive tritium control. In this paper, the state of DCLL development in the US is presented including recent design modifications and results from recent R{\&}D efforts. Such R{\&}D includes the progress on development and property quantification of SiC/SiC composites and SiC foams as candidate FCI materials; Pb-17Li material capability and infiltration studies; simulations of MHD Pb-17Li flow characteristics and of resultant temperature distributions; and the analysis of FCI stress states based on these thermal loads. In addition, tritium extraction from Pb-17Li based on a vacuum permeator concept is shown to have the potential to achieve the desired tritium control. A discussion of DCLL optimization and unresolved DCLL issues and future R{\&}D needs is also presented. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In fusion liquid metal (LM) blankets, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects will dominate the pressure drop and velocity profiles of the liquid metal flow, including the manifold regions needed to distribute flow. However, there is very little experimental data available for manifolds with geometry and orientation to the magnetic field similar to typical dual-coolant lead-lithium (DCLL) blanket designs-and the data that does exist indicates strong non-uniformity of flow partitioning between parallel channels can occur. In order to begin to address these issues for the US DCLL blanket design, a series of 3D MHD simulations has been performed at relevant magnetic interaction parameters. The geometry considered has a single rectangular supply channel entering a rectangular expansion with toroidal field oriented along the expansion direction, finally feeding into 3 rectangular parallel channels stacked in the field direction. These simulations match the range of experimental conditions achievable in a concurrent experimental test campaign. Various conditions of flowrate and field strength are explored. The MHD effects generally act to make the flow distribution more uniform than without a field. However flow imbalances as great as 26{\%} from uniform are seen under the conditions analyzed. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The proposed use of a flowing liquid metal layers as virtual first-walls for magnetic fusion energy reactors has prompted the development of numerical models capable of predicting the motion of such free surface liquid-metal flows within complex geometry boundaries and in the presence of strong magnetic fields. Several model variants were developed that utilize the assumption of toroidal axisymmetry to simplify the governing Navier-Stokes and Maxwell's equations to a 2D form. Typically an induced magnetic field formulation has been used to model eddy current formation and various numerical methods and free surface tracking techniques (including height function and volume-of-fluid) have been employed. These axisymmetric models predict a variety of interesting behavior including the effect of toroidal field gradients on the velocity profiles and stability, and the effect of surface-normal magnetic field components on toroidal motion and flow thickness. However, axisymmetric models cannot be used to simulate the true 3D geometry and magnetic field configuration of a magnetic fusion reactor. And so, a 3D, flexible geometry, multiple material, free surface magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solver called HIMAG has been developed over the past several years. The HIMAG formulation is described in detail along with the results of several initial benchmark problems. Preliminary data from the application of HIMAG to several fusion relevant liquid wall problems including: (1) motion of lithium in a new sample holder for the Diverter Materials Evaluation System (DiMES) experiment on the DIII-D tokamak facility; (2) motion of gallium alloy in a quasi-2D film flow test section in the MTOR facility; (3) motion of gallium alloy in a 3D field film flow test section in the MTOR facility; are also presented and discussed. Finally, future plans for the HIMAG code, including application to the simulation of the effect of insulator coating cracks on closed channel MHD flows, are described. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper presents a numerical simulation of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) liquid metal flow around a square cylinder placed in a rectangular duct. In the hydrodynamic case, for a certain parameter range the well-known Karman vortex street with three-dimensional flow patterns is observed, similar to the flow around a circular cylinder. In this study a uniform magnetic field aligned with the cylinder is applied and its influence on the formation and downstream transport of vortices is investigated. The relevant key parameters for the MHD flow are the Hartmann number M, the interaction parameter N and the hydrodynamic Reynolds number, all based on the side length of the cylinder. The Hartmann number M was varied in the range 0 less than or equal to M less than or equal to 85 and the interaction parameter N in the range 0 less than or equal to N less than or equal to 36. Results are presented for two fixed Reynolds numbers Re = 200 and Re = 250. The magnetic Reynolds number is assumed to be very small. The results of the numerical simulation are compared with known experimental and theoretical results. The hydrodynamic simulation shows characteristic intermittent pulsations of the drag and lift force on the cylinder. At Re = 200 a mix of secondary spanwise three-dimensional instabilities (A and B mode, rib vortices) could be observed. The spanwise wavelength of the rib vortices was found to be about 2-3 cylinder side lengths in the near wake. At Re = 250 the flow appears more organized showing a regular B mode pattern and a spanwise wavelength of about 1 cylinder side length. With an applied magnetic field a quasi-two-dimensional flow can be obtained at low N approximate to 1 due to the strong non-isotropic character of the electromagnetic forces. The remaining vortices have their axes aligned with the magnetic field. With increasing magnetic fields these vortices are further damped due to Hartmann braking. The result that the 'quasi-two-dimensional' vortices have a curvature in the direction of the magnetic field can be explained by means of an asymptotic analysis of the governing equations. With very high magnetic fields the time-dependent vortex shedding can be almost completely suppressed. By three-dimensional visualization it was possible to show characteristic paths of the electric current for this kind of flow, explaining the action of the Lorentz forces.},

Morley, M.A. Abdou, A current density conservative scheme for incompressible MHD flows at a low magnetic Reynolds number. Part II: on an arbitrary collocated mesh, Journal of Computational Physics 227 (2007) 205-228] has been extended and specially designed for calculation of the Lorentz force on a staggered grid system (Part III) by solving the electrical potential equation for magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) at a low magnetic Reynolds number. In a staggered mesh, pressure (p) and electrical potential ($\phi$) are located in the cell center, while velocities and current fluxes are located on the cell faces of a main control volume. The scheme numerically meets the physical conservation laws, charge conservation law and momentum conservation law. Physically, the Lorentz force conserves the momentum when the magnetic field is constant or spatial coordinate independent. The calculation of current density fluxes on cell faces is conducted using a scheme consistent with the discretization for solution of the electrical potential Poisson equation, which can ensure the calculated current density conserves the charge. A divergence formula of the Lorentz force is used to calculate the Lorentz force at the cell center of a main control volume, which can numerically conserve the momentum at constant or spatial coordinate independent magnetic field. The calculated cell-center Lorentz forces are then interpolated to the cell faces, which are used to obtain the corresponding velocity fluxes by solving the momentum equations. The " conservative" is an important property of the scheme, which can guarantee computational accuracy of MHD flows at high Hartmann number with a strongly non-uniform mesh employed to resolve the Hartmann layers and side layers. 2D fully developed MHD flows with analytical solutions available have been conducted to validate the scheme at a staggered mesh. 3D MHD flows, with the experimental data available, at a constant magnetic field in a rectangular duct with sudden expansion and at a varying magnetic field in a rectangular duct are conducted on a staggered mesh to verify the computational accuracy of the scheme. It is expected that the scheme for the Lorentz force can be employed together with a fully conservative scheme for the convective term and the pressure term [Y. Morinishi, T.S. Lund, O.V.

In this collocated grid, velocity (u), pressure (p), and electrical potential ($\phi$) are located in the grid center, while current fluxes are located on the cell faces. The calculation of current fluxes on the cell faces is conducted using a conservative scheme, which is consistent with the discretization scheme for the solution of electrical potential Poisson equation. A conservative interpolation is used to get the current density at the cell center, which is used to conduct the calculation of Lorentz force at the cell center for momentum equations. We will show that both "conservative" and "consistent" are important properties of the scheme to get an accurate result for high Hartmann number MHD flows with a strongly non-uniform mesh employed to resolve the Hartmann layers and side layers of Hunt's conductive walls and Shercliff's insulated walls. A general second-order projection method has been developed for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with the Lorentz force included. This projection method can accurately balance the pressure term and the Lorentz force for a fully developed core flow. This method can also simplify the pressure boundary conditions for MHD flows. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {It is numerically demonstrated by means of a magnetohydrodynamics code that precession can trigger the dynamo effect in a cylindrical container. When the Reynolds number, based on the radius of the cylinder and its angular velocity, increases, the flow, which is initially centrosymmetric, loses its stability and bifurcates to a quasiperiodic motion. This unsteady and asymmetric flow is shown to be capable of sustaining dynamo action in the linear and nonlinear regimes. Themagnetic field thus generated is unsteady and quadrupolar. These numerical evidences of dynamo action in a precessing cylindrical container may be useful for an experiment now planned at the Dresden sodium facility for dynamo and thermohydraulic studies in Germany.},

@article{Pattison2008,
abstract = {In this paper, an approach to simulating magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows based on the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is presented. The dynamics of the flow are simulated using a so-called multiple relaxation time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE), in which a source term is included for the Lorentz force. The evolution of the magnetic induction is represented by introducing a vector distribution function and then solving an appropriate lattice kinetic equation for this function. The solution of both distribution functions are obtained through a simple, explicit, and computationally efficient stream-and-collide procedure. The use of the MRT collision term enhances the numerical stability over that of a single relaxation time approach. To apply the methodology to solving practical problems, a new extrapolation-based method for imposing magnetic boundary conditions is introduced and a technique for simulating steady-state flows with low magnetic Prandtl number is developed. In order to resolve thin layers near the walls arising in the presence of high magnetic fields, a non-uniform gridding strategy is introduced through an interpolated-streaming step applied to both distribution functions. These advances are particularly important for applications in fusion engineering where liquid metal flows with low magnetic Prandtl numbers and high Hartmann numbers are introduced. A number of MHD benchmark problems, under various physical and geometrical conditions are presented, including 3-D MHD lid driven cavity flow, high Hartmann number flows and turbulent MHD flows, with good agreement with prior data. Due to the local nature of the method, the LBM also demonstrated excellent performance on parallel machines, with almost linear scaling up to 128 processors for a MHD flow problem. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The energy spectrum of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence attracts interest due to its fundamental importance and its relevance for interpreting astrophysical data. Here we present measurements of the energy spectra from a series of high-resolution direct numerical simulations of magnetohydrodynamics turbulence with a strong guide field and for increasing Reynolds number. The presented simulations, with numerical resolutions up to 2048{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}3{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} mesh points and statistics accumulated over 30 to 150 eddy turnover times, constitute, to the best of our knowledge, the largest statistical sample of steady state magnetohydrodynamics turbulence to date. We study both the balanced case, where the energies associated with Alfv{\'{e}}n modes propagating in opposite directions along the guide field, E{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}(k{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊥{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) and E{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}(k{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊥{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}), are equal, and the imbalanced case where the energies are different. In the balanced case, we find that the energy spectrum converges to a power law with exponent -3/2 as the Reynolds number is increased, which is consistent with phenomenological models that include scale-dependent dynamic alignment. For the imbalanced case, with E{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textgreater}E{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, the simulations show that E{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}∝k{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊥{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-3/2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} for all Reynolds numbers considered, while E{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} has a slightly steeper spectrum at small Re. As the Reynolds number increases, E{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} flattens. Since E{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}±{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} are pinned at the dissipation scale and anchored at the driving scales, we postulate that at sufficiently high Re the spectra will become parallel in the inertial range and scale as E{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}∝E{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}∝k{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊥{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-3/2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}.

In this formulation the issues involving boundary conditions for the intermediate velocity variables and the pressure are clearly resolved. In addition, it is shown that poor temporal accuracy (first-order) is not due to boundary conditions, but due to the method itself. A generalized block LU decomposition that overcomes this difficulty is presented, allowing arbitrarily high temporal order of accuracy. The generalized decomposition is shown to be useful for a wide range of problems including steady problems. Technical issues, such as stability and the appropriate pressure update scheme, are also addressed.

The MHD problem couples the Navier-Stokes equations and a Darcy-type system for the electric potential via Lorentz's force in the momentum equation of the Navier-Stokes equations and the currents generated by the moving fluid in Ohm's law. The key feature of the FE formulation resides in the design of the stabilization terms, which serve several purposes. First, the formulation is suitable for convection dominated flows. Second, there is no need to use interpolation spaces constrained to a compatibility condition in both sub-problems and therefore, equal-order interpolation spaces can be used for all the unknowns. Finally, this formulation leads to a coupled linear system; this monolithic approach is effective, since the coupling can be dealt by effective preconditioning and iterative solvers that allows to deal with high Hartmann numbers. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Potherat2007,
abstract = {Inspired by the experiment from Moresco and Alboussiere [J. Fluid Mech.504, 167 (Year: 2004)], we study the stability of a flow of liquid metal in a rectangular, electrically insulating duct with a steady homogeneous magnetic field perpendicular to two of the walls. In this configuration, the Lorentz force tends to eliminate the velocity variations in the direction of the magnetic field. This leads to a quasi-two-dimensional base flow with Hartmann boundary layers near the walls perpendicular to the magnetic field, and so-called Shercliff layers in the vicinity of the walls parallel to the field. Also, the Lorentz force tends to strongly oppose the growth of perturbations with a dependence along the magnetic field direction. On these grounds, we represent the flow using the model from Sommeria and Moreau [J. Fluid Mech.118, 507 (Year: 1982)], which essentially consists of two-dimensional (2D) motion equations with a linear friction term accounting for the effect of the Hartmann layers. The simplicity of this quasi-2D model makes it possible to study the stability and transient growth of quasi-two-dimensional perturbations over an extensive range of nondimensional parameters and reach the limit of high magnetic fields. In this asymptotic case, the Reynolds number based on the Shercliff layer thickness {\$}\backslashmathrm{\{}Re{\}}/H{\^{}}{\{}1/2{\}}{\$} becomes the only relevant parameter. Tollmien–Schlichting waves are the most linearly unstable mode as for the Poiseuille flow, but for {\$}H\backslashgeq42{\$}, a second unstable mode, symmetric about the duct axis, appears with a lower growth rate. We find that these layers are linearly unstable for {\$}\backslashmathrm{\{}Re{\}}/H{\^{}}{\{}1/2{\}}\backslashgeq48350{\$} and energetically stable for {\$}\backslashmathrm{\{}Re{\}}/H{\^{}}{\{}1/2{\}}\backslashleq65.32{\$}. Between these two bounds, some nonmodal quasi-two-dimensional perturbations undergo some significant transient growth (between two and seven times more than in the case of a purely 2D Poiseuille flow, and for much more subcritical values of {\$}\backslashmathrm{\{}Re{\}}{\$}). In the limit of a high magnetic field, the maximum gain {\$}G{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}max{\}}{\$} associated with this transient growth is found to vary as {\$}G{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}max{\}}\backslashsim(\backslashmathrm{\{}Re{\}}/\backslashmathrm{\{}Re{\}}{\_}c){\^{}}{\{}2/3{\}}{\$} and occur at time {\$}t{\_}{\{}G{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}max{\}}{\}}\backslashsim(\backslashmathrm{\{}Re{\}}/\backslashmathrm{\{}Re{\}}{\_}c){\^{}}{\{}1/3{\}}{\$} for streamwise wavenumbers of the same order of magnitude as the critical wavenumber for the linear stability.},

abstract = {Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence at low magnetic Reynolds number is experimentally investigated by studying a liquid metal flow in a cubic domain. We focus on the mechanisms that determine whether the flow is quasi-two-dimensional, three-dimensional or in any intermediate state. To this end, forcing is applied by injecting a DC current I through one wall of the cube only, to drive vortices spinning along the magnetic field. Depending on the intensity of the externally applied magnetic field, these vortices extend part or all of the way through the cube. Driving the flow in this way allows us to precisely control not only the forcing intensity but also its dimensionality. A comparison with the theoretical analysis of this configuration singles out the influences of the walls and of the forcing on the flow dimensionality. Flow dimensionality is characterised in several ways. First, we show that when inertia drives three-dimensionality, the velocity near the wall where current is injected scales as U-b similar to I-2/3. Second, we show that when the distance l(z) over which momentum diffuses under the action of the Lorentz force (Sommeria {\&} Moreau, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 118, 1982, pp. 507-518) reaches the channel width h, the velocity near the opposite wall U-t follows a similar law with a correction factor (1-h/l(z)) that measures three-dimensionality. When l(z) {\textless} h, by contrast, the opposite wall has less influence on the flow and U-t similar to I-1/2. The central role played by the ratio l(z)/h is confirmed by experimentally verifying the scaling l(z) similar to N-1/2 put forward by Sommeria {\&} Moreau (N is the interaction parameter) and, finally, the nature of the three-dimensionality involved is further clarified by distinguishing weak and strong three-dimensionalities previously introduced by Klein {\&} Potherat (Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 104 (3), 2010, 034502). It is found that both types vanish only asymptotically in the limit N --{\textgreater} infinity. This provides evidence that because of the no-slip walls, (i) the transition between quasi-two-dimensional and three-dimensional turbulence does not result from a global instability of the flow, unlike in domains with non-dissipative boundaries (Boeck et al. Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 101, 2008, 244501), and (ii) it does not occur simultaneously at all scales.},

@article{Pouquet1976,
abstract = {Turbulence and magnetic fields are a common feature of many celestial bodies. To understand the turbulent generation of large-scale magnetic fields, a new nonlinear theory is developed for three-dimensional homogeneous isotropic incompressible MHD turbulence with helicity, i.e., not statistically invariant under plane reflexions. A modification of the eddy-damped quasi-normal Markovian approximation is used, where the eddy-damping rate includes a contribution from Alfven waves. The resulting closed-form equations for the evolution of the kinetic and magnetic energy and helicity spectra are studied both theoretically and numerically for cases with high Reynolds number and unit magnetic Prandtl number. A nonlinear turbulent dynamo is obtained which needs only kinetic energy and helicity injection plus a seed of magnetic field. The study confirms the importance of helicity both in its kinetic and in its magnetic form for generation of large-scale magnetic fields by turbulence.},

@article{Priest1986,
abstract = {A new unified family of models for incompressible, steady-state magnetic reconnection in a finite region is presented. The models are obtained by expanding in powers of the Alfven Mach number and may be used to elucidate some of the puzzling properties of numerical experiments on reconnection which are not present in the classical models. The conditions imposed on the inflow boundary of the finite region determine which member of the family occurs. Petscheklien and Sonnerup like solutions are particular members. The Sonneruplike regime is a special case of a weak slow mode expansion in the inflow region, and it separates two classes of members with reversed currents. The Petscheklike regime is a singular case of a weak fast mode expansion, and it separates the hybrid regime from a regime of slow mode compressions. Care should be taken in deciding which type of reconnection is operating in a numerical experiment. Indeed, no experiment to date has used boundary conditions appropriate for demonstrating steady state Petschek reconnection.},

abstract = {The jets observed to emanate from many compact accreting objects may arise from the twisting of the magnetic field threading a differentially rotating accretion disk which acts to magnetically extract angular momentum and energy from the disk. Two main regimes have been discussed, hydromagnetic outflows, which have a significant mass flux and have energy and angular momentum carried by both matter and electromagnetic field and, Poynting outflows, where the mass flux is negligible and energy and angular momentum are carried predominantly by the electromagnetic field. We describe recent theoretical work on the formation of relativistic Poynting jets from magnetized accretion disks and new relativistic, fully-electromagnetic, particle-in-cell simulations of the formation of jets from accretion disks.},

abstract = {Planets and stars are often capable of generating their own magnetic fields. This occurs through dynamo processes occurring via turbulent convective stirring of their respective molten metal-rich cores and plasma-based convection zones. Present-day numerical models of planetary and stellar dynamo action are not carried out using fluids properties that mimic the essential properties of liquid metals and plasmas (e.g., using fluids with thermal Prandtl numbers Pr {\textless} 1 and magnetic Prandtl numbers Pm ≪ 1). Metal dynamo simulations should become possible, though, within the next decade. In order then to understand the turbulent convection phenomena occurring in geophysical or astrophysical fluids and next-generation numerical models thereof, we present here canonical, end-member examples of thermally-driven convection in liquid gallium, first with no magnetic field or rotation present, then with the inclusion of a background magnetic field and then in a rotating system (without an imposed magnetic field). In doing so, we demonstrate the essential behaviors of convecting liquid metals that are necessary for building, as well as benchmarking, accurate, robust models of magnetohydrodynamic processes in Pm ≪ Pr {\textless} 1 geophysical and astrophysical systems. Our study results also show strong agreement between laboratory and numerical experiments, demonstrating that high resolution numerical simulations can be made capable of modeling the liquid metal convective turbulence needed in accurate next-generation dynamo models.},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {This work presents a finite element solution of the 3D magneto-hydrodynamics equations. The formulation takes explicitly into account the local conservation of the magnetic field, giving rise to a conservative formulation and introducing a new scalar variable. A stabilization technique is used in order to allow equal linear interpolation on tetrahedral elements of all the variables. Numerical tests are performed in order to assess the stability and the accuracy of the resulting methods. The convergence rates are calculated for different stabilization parameters.

abstract = {The present-day Universe is highly magnetized, even though the first magnetic seed fields were most probably extremely weak. To explain the growth of the magnetic field strength over many orders of magnitude fast amplification processes need to operate. The most efficient mechanism known today is the small-scale dynamo, which converts turbulent kinetic energy into magnetic energy leading to an exponential growth of the magnetic field. The efficiency of the dynamo depends on the type of turbulence indicated by the slope of the turbulence spectrum v(l) $\backslash$propto l{\^{}}{\{}theta{\}}, where v(l) is the eddy velocity at a scale l. We explore turbulent spectra ranging from incompressible Kolmogorov turbulence with theta = 1/3 to highly compressible Burgers turbulence with theta = 1/2. In this work we analyze the properties of the small-scale dynamo for low magnetic Prandtl numbers Pm, which denotes the ratio of the magnetic Reynolds number, Rm, to the hydrodynamical one, Re. We solve the Kazantsev equation, which describes the evolution of the small-scale magnetic field, using the WKB approximation. In the limit of low magnetic Prandtl numbers the growth rate is proportional to Rm{\^{}}{\{}(1-theta)/(1+theta){\}}. We furthermore discuss the critical magnetic Reynolds number Rm{\_}crit, which is required for small-scale dynamo action. The value of Rm{\_}crit is roughly 100 for Kolmogorov turbulence and 2700 for Burgers. Furthermore, we discuss that Rm{\_}crit provides a stronger constraint in the limit of low Pm than it does for large Pm. We conclude that the small-scale dynamo can operate in the regime of low magnetic Prandtl numbers, if the magnetic Reynolds number is large enough. Thus, the magnetic field amplification on small scales can take place in a broad range of physical environments and amplify week magnetic seed fields on short timescales.},

abstract = {This paper explores the development of a scalable, nonlinear, fully-implicit stabilized unstructured finite element (FE) capability for 2D incompressible (reduced) resistive MHD. The discussion considers the implementation of a stabilized FE formulation in context of a fully-implicit time integration and direct-to-steady-state solution capability. The nonlinear solver strategy employs Newton-Krylov methods, which are preconditioned using fully-coupled algebraic multilevel preconditioners. These preconditioners are shown to enable a robust, scalable and efficient solution approach for the large-scale sparse linear systems generated by the Newton linearization. Verification results demonstrate the expected order-of-accuracy for the stabilized FE discretization. The approach is tested on a variety of prototype problems, including both low-Lundquist number (e.g., an MHD Faraday conduction pump and a hydromagnetic Rayleigh-Bernard linear stability calculation) and moderately-high Lundquist number (magnetic island coalescence problem) examples. Initial results that explore the scaling of the solution methods are presented on up to 4096 processors for problems with up to 64M unknowns on a CrayXT3/4. Additionally, a large-scale proof-of-capability calculation for 1 billion unknowns for the MHD Faraday pump problem on 24,000 cores is presented. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Shercliff1956a,
abstract = {The flow rate of liquid metals is commonly measured by electromagnetic flowmeters. In these the fluid moves through a region of transverse magnetic field, inducing a potential difference between two electrodes on the walls of the pipe. The ratio of signal to flow rate is dependent on the velocity profile, and this is affected by electromagnetic forces. In this paper the ultimate steady velocity profile and its associated pressure gradient and induced potential are calculated for the case of laminar flow in a circular pipe whose walls are conducting but without contact resistance. Laminar flow is encouraged by a transverse field. When the fluid conductivity and field strength are sufficiently high, boundary layers occur with a thickness inversely proportional to normal field intensity. The induced potential difference is then 0{\textperiodcentered}926 of the value corresponding to the case of uniform velocity if the walls are non-conducting. The distance the fluid must travel after entering the transverse field before the steady state is reached is next estimated by a Rayleigh approximation. The inlet velocity is taken to be uniform and effects which occur at the edge of the field are neglected. The process falls into two stages, first a boundary-layer growth and then an adjustment of the velocity away from the walls, occupying a much greater length of pipe. The entry length is shorter than it is in the case of flow in a rectangular pipe, but is still too long for appreciable distortion of the velocity profile to occur within practical flowmeters except at low flow rates. The pressure drop associated with the adjustment of the velocity profile is found to be independent of field strength, if this is high, and about one-eighth of the drop which occurs in the non-conducting case. Experiments are described in which steady-state pressure gradients and induced potential differences were measured in mercury flowing along Perspex pipes of 0{\textperiodcentered}5 and 0{\textperiodcentered}25 in. bore in transverse fields up to 14500 gauss. The results confirmed the steady-state theory within the limitations of experimental accuracy and the assumption in the theory of high conductivity and an intense field. The experiments also covered the entry region in many cases, and showed that the theoretical entry lengths were correct in order of magnitude but over-estimated. However, the exact entry condition was uncertain, and steady readings were difficult to obtain in the entry region.},

abstract = {Lithium as a potential plasma-facing material has many attractive features including a reduction in recycling of hydrogenic species and ability to withstand high heat and neutron fluxes in fusion reactors. Recent analysis of the National Spherical Torus eXperiment (NSTX) device has shown significant and recurring benefits of lithium coatings on plasma-facing components performance. To self-consistently study the performance of lithium divertor during ELMs and disruptions in NSTX, integrated multi-fluid and multi-dimensional models are being developed based on HEIGHTS simulation package that address and combine several areas from the bulk plasma energy released to the magneto-hydrodynamic evolution and production of lithium plasma in the complex magnetic field structure. The simulation showed the importance of the 3D geometrical effects on divertor erosion dynamics. Lithium expansion in divertor and SOL areas may potentially cause bulk plasma contamination during high power ELMs. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {3-D thin-shear-layer equations for flows of conducting fluids in a magnetic field have been derived in orthogonal body-oriented coordinates and then applied to the analysis of MHD open-surface flows over a curved wall. Unlike the classic boundary-layer-type equations, present ones permit information to be propagated upstream through the induced magnetic field. Another departure from the classic theory is that the normal momentum equation keeps the balance between the pressure gradient term, and those related to gravity, centrifugal forces, and Lorentz force. Thus, the normal pressure variations are allowed. The model describes basic 3-D effects due to the wall curvature and spatial variations of the applied magnetic field. As a particular case, equations for flows with rotational symmetry have been derived. Numerical calculations were performed for open-surface flows over a body of revolution under conditions relevant to a fusion reactor (Hartmann number is 8500). Some specific flow patterns, such as flow thickening and spiral-type flows, have been observed and discussed. A special attention has been paid to the analysis of the magnetic propulsion as a tool for the active flow control by applying an electric current. It has been shown that depending on the applied current, the axial pressure gradient can act as an adverse pressure gradient or propulsion force. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows turbulence reduction occurs due to the Joule dissipation. It results in heat transfer degradation. In open channel flows, heat transfer degradation is also caused by the turbulence redistribution near the free surface. Both effects can be significant in fusion applications with low-conductivity fluids such as molten salts. In the present study, the "K-$\epsilon$" model equations for turbulent flows and the free surface boundary condition are adjusted with taking into account MHD effects. Different orientations of the magnetic field, perpendicular and parallel to the main flow, have been considered. The model coefficients have been tuned by a computer optimization using available experimental data for the friction factor. The effect of free surface heat transfer degradation due to the turbulence redistribution has been implemented through the variation of the turbulent Prandtl number. As an example, the model is used for the analysis of a turbulent MHD flow down an inclined chute with the heat flux applied to the free surface. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The important steps in the development of MHD codes starting from the 1970s are outlined first and then basic MHD codes, which are currently in use by designers of liquid breeder blankets, are reviewed. A benchmark database of five problems has been proposed to cover a wide range of MHD flows from laminar fully developed to turbulent flows, which are of interest for fusion applications: (A) 2D fully developed laminar steady MHD flow, (B) 3D laminar, steady developing MHD flow in a non-uniform magnetic field, (C) quasi-two-dimensional MHD turbulent flow, (D) 3D turbulent MHD flow, and (E) MHD flow with heat transfer (buoyant convection). Finally, we introduce important details of the proposed activities, such as basic V{\&}V rules and schedule. The main goal of the present paper is to help in establishing an efficient V{\&}V framework and to initiate benchmarking among interested parties. The comparison results computed by the codes against analytical solutions and trusted experimental and numerical data as well as code-to-code comparisons will be presented and analyzed in companion paper/papers.},

The equation for the induced electric current is derived by taking the curl of the induction equation and using Amp??re's law. Boundary conditions on the induced electric current are derived at the interface between the liquid and the thin conducting wall by considering the current loop closing in the wall and the adjacent liquid. These boundary conditions at the liquid-solid interface include the Robin boundary condition for the wall-normal component of the current and an additional equation for the wall potential to compute the tangential current component. The suggested formulation (denominated j-formulation) is applied to three common types of MHD wall-bounded flows by implementing the finite-difference technique: (i) high Hartmann number fully developed flows in a rectangular duct with conducting walls; (ii) quasi-two-dimensional duct flow in the entry into a magnet; and (iii) flow past a magnetic obstacle. Comparisons have been performed against the traditional formulation based on the induced magnetic field (B-formulation), demonstrating very good agreement.},

abstract = {The dual-coolant lead-lithium (DCLL) blanket concept is considered in the US for testing in ITER and as a candidate for using in DEMO reactor. In this blanket, the eutectic alloy lead-lithium circulates slowly as a coolant and breeder in the presence of a strong plasma-confining magnetic field, experiencing magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects. This paper overviews the ongoing studies for the MHD flows in the US DCLL blanket, focusing mostly on the poloidal flows where most of the volumetric heating is deposited and the MHD effects are therefore of primary importance. The paper introduces qualitative description of MHD flows in the blanket along with mathematical models and numerical and analytical results to address such phenomena as the near-wall jet formation, quasi-two-dimensional MHD turbulence, and buoyant flows. Special consideration is given to the buoyancy effects in the buoyancy-opposed flows, where superposition of forced and buoyant flows may lead to locally reverse or recirculation flows. The present analysis suggests that such flows are possible both in ITER and DEMO scenarios. We also discuss conditions when the poloidal flows in the blanket turn to be turbulent. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The paper focuses on the important blanket feasibility issues, such as the MHD pressure drop, heat leakages from PbLi into the cooling helium flows, and the temperature distributions in the insulating flow insert and at the material interface. Both ITER scenarios look acceptable, i.e., all material restrictions can be easily met. In the DEMO scenario, the flow insert operates in harsh conditions causing high temperature drop in the insert and high interface temperature between the hot PbLi and the ferritic structure that may exceed the allowable material limits. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We review previous studies on instabilities and transitions in magnetohydrodynamic flows in a special context of liquid-metal blanket applications. In the past, possible transitions in blanket flows were mostly attributed to instabilities in the Hartmann layers. More recent studies show, however, that the side layers can experience instabilities at sufficiently lower Reynolds numbers. This suggests that in the blanket flows, the appearance of turbulence can most likely be related to the side rather than Hartmann layers. Various factors that may affect stability in blanket flows have been discussed. In particular, buoyancy forces can result in potentially unstable inflectional velocity profiles. First computational results, illustrating possibility of instabilities and quasi-two-dimensional turbulence in vertical mixed-convection flows heated volumetrically are presented. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Observations from planetary spacecraft missions have demonstrated a spectrum of dynamo behaviour in planets. From currently active dynamos, to remanent crustal fields from past dynamo action, to no observed magnetization, the planets and moons in our solar system offer magnetic clues to their interior structure and evolution. Here we review numerical dynamo simulations for planets other than Earth. For the terrestrial planets and satellites, we discuss specific magnetic field oddities that dynamo models attempt to explain. For the giant planets, we discuss both non-magnetic and magnetic convection models and their ability to reproduce observations of surface zonal flows and magnetic field morphology. Future improvements to numerical models and new missions to collect planetary magnetic data will continue to improve our understanding of the magnetic field generation process inside planets. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Author(s).},

abstract = {It is widely known that cosmic magnetic fields, i.e. the fields of planets, stars, and galaxies, are produced by the hydromagnetic dynamo effect in moving electrically conducting fluids. It is less well known that cosmic magnetic fields play also an active role in cosmic structure formation by enabling outward transport of angular momentum in accretion disks via the magnetorotational instability (MRI). Considerable theoretical and computational progress has been made in understanding both processes. In addition to this, the last ten years have seen tremendous efforts in studying both effects in liquid metal experiments. In 1999, magnetic field self-excitation was observed in the large scale liquid sodium facilities in Riga and Karlsruhe. Recently, self-excitation was also obtained in the French "von Karman sodium" (VKS) experiment. An MRI-like mode was found on the background of a turbulent spherical Couette flow at the University of Maryland. Evidence for MRI as the first instability of an hydrodynamically stable flow was obtained in the "Potsdam Rossendorf Magnetic Instability Experiment" (PROMISE). In this review, the history of dynamo and MRI related experiments is delineated, and some directions of future work are discussed.},

abstract = {The three-dimensional velocity field of a propeller-driven liquid metal flow is reconstructed by a contactless inductive flow tomography. The underlying theory is presented within the framework of an integral equation system that governs the magnetic field distribution in a moving electrically conducting fluid. For small magnetic Reynolds numbers this integral equation system can be cast into a linear inverse problem for the determination of the velocity field from externally measured magnetic fields. A robust reconstruction of the large scale velocity field is already achieved by applying the external magnetic field alternately in two orthogonal directions and measuring the corresponding sets of induced magnetic fields. Kelvin's theorem is exploited to regularize the resulting velocity field by using the kinetic energy of the flow as a regularizing functional. The results of this technique are shown to be in satisfactory agreement with ultrasonic measurements.},

The FCI and duct geometry match those of an experiment performed recently in Southwestern Institute of Physics (SWIP), China. The experimental FCI is made of epoxy and has a pressure equalization slot (PES) in one wall, which is perpendicular to the applied magnetic field. Previous 2D modeling efforts based on the fully developed flow model have demonstrated a significant difference with the experimental results in the MHD pressure drop, indicating 3D effects may be significant. The new 3D results, obtained with an unstructured, parallel MHD solver HIMAG, are in fair agreement with the experimental data. These results confirm a substantial reduction in MHD pressure drop by the FCI, but not as significant as would be expected under fully developed flow conditions.},

This instability can appear as modes of azimuthal wavenumbers m=2, 3,... that have very similar pattern speeds $\backslash$omega/m, while the m=1 mode, which would appear as the fundamental of this discrete spectrum, is less unstable. This would readily explain the 2:3 (and sometimes higher) frequency ratio observed between these QPO. These instabilites form eigenmodes, i.e. standing wave patterns at a constant frequency in the disk; they are strongly unstable, and thus do not need an external excitation mechanism to reach high amplitudes. Furthermore, they have the property that a fraction of the accretion energy can be emitted toward the corona: this would explain that these QPO are seen in a spectral state where Comptonized emission from the corona is always present. Their existence depends critically on the existence of a magnetic structure, formed by poloidal flux advected in the accretion process, in the central region between the disk and the black hole.},

The analytical results agreed well with the experimental results for the velocity profiles in mercury flow and skin friction coefficients in mercury and lithium flows.

In quench analyses, the two-dimensional ANSYS model was used to estimate the thermal diffusion from the heated conductor to the cold radial plate. The analyses show that the TF coils have sufficiently high minimum quench energy (around 300 mJ/cc-strand) against the mechanical disturbance and the disturbance due to a plasma disruption. The maximum temperature obtained in the quench analysis is allowable, for the condition of the detection voltage of 0.2 V, delay time of 2 s and the discharge time constant of 11 s. It is confirmed that the coils will be operated with reasonable margin and discharged without any damage if an unexpected quench occurs.},

This process involves reconnection of magnetic field lines in a manner that destroys all the topological invariants of ideal plasma so that only total magnetic helicity survives. Although this mechanism, and the equations describing the relaxed state, are similar in all systems, the properties of the relaxed state depend crucially on the topology—toroidal or spherical—of the container and on the boundary conditions. Consequently there are several different types of relaxed state, each with its own special characteristics, which are derived and discussed. The measurements made on many experiments, including toroidal pinches, OHTE, multipinch, and spheromaks, are reviewed and shown to be in striking agreement with the theoretical predictions.},

Two series of measurements are reported, one in which the force is determined through the angular velocity of a rotary magnet system and one in which the force on a fixed magnet system is measured directly. Both experiments confirm that the measured signal is a linear function of the flow velocity. We then derive the scaling law that relates the force on a localized distribution of magnetized material to the velocity of an electrically conducting fluid. This law shows that LFV, if properly designed, has a wide range of potential applications in metallurgy, semiconductor crystal growth, and glass manufacturing.},

It is based on the measurement of a force on a magnet system that acts upon the flow. We formulate the theory of the Lorentz force flowmeter which connects the measured force to the unknown flow rate. We first apply the theory to three specific cases, namely (i) pipe flow exposed to a longitudinal magnetic field, (ii) pipe flow under the influence of a transverse magnetic field and (iii) interaction of a localized distribution of magnetic material with a uniformly moving sheet of metal. These examples provide the key scaling laws of the method and illustrate how the force depends on the shape of the velocity profile and the presence of turbulent fluctuations in the flow. Moreover, we formulate the general kinematic theory which holds for arbitrary distributions of magnetic material or electric currents and for any velocity distribution and which provides a rational framework for the prediction of the sensitivity of Lorentz force flowmeters in laboratory experiments and in industrial practice.},

The first problem involves disturbance vorticity which is perpendicular to the magnetic field, and these disturbances decay for all wavelengths and Reynolds numbers. The second problem involves disturbance vorticity which is parallel to the magnetic field, and the critical Reynolds number for these disturbances is 313. The critical disturbance involves a short axial scale and a high velocity in the direction perpendicular to the side. Both of these characteristics have positive implications for the heat transfer through this boundary layer. This heat transfer is important in liquid-lithium cooling systems or "self-cooled blankets" for magnetic confinement fusion reactors. In such blankets, a high-velocity boundary layer occurs adjacent to the "first wall", which faces the fusing plasma. ?? 1991.},

abstract = {Seven schemes to maintain the ∇{\textperiodcentered}B=0 constraint numerically are compared. All these algorithms can be combined with shock-capturing Godunov type base schemes. They fall into three categories: the eight-wave formulation maintains the constraint to truncation error, the projection scheme enforces the constraint in some discretization by projecting the magnetic field, while the five different versions of the constrained transport/central difference type schemes conserve ∇{\textperiodcentered}B to machine accuracy in some discretization for every grid cell. It is shown that the three constrained transport algorithms, which have been introduced recently, can be recast into pure finite volume schemes, and the staggered representation of the magnetic field is unnecessary. Another two new and simple central difference based algorithms are introduced. The properties of the projection scheme are discussed in some detail, and I prove that it has the same order of accuracy as the base scheme even for discontinuous solutions. I describe a flexible and efficient implementation of the projection scheme using conjugate gradient type iterative methods. Generalizations to resistive MHD, to axial symmetry, and to non-Cartesian grids are given for all schemes. The theoretical discussion is followed by numerical tests, where the robustness, accuracy, and efficiency of the seven schemes and the base scheme can be directly compared. All simulations are done with the Versatile Advection Code, in which several shock-capturing base schemes are implemented. Although the eight-wave formulation usually works correctly, one of the numerical tests demonstrates that its non-conservative nature can occasionally produce incorrect jumps across strong discontinuities. Based on a large number of tests, the projection scheme, one of the new central difference based schemes, and one of the constrained transport schemes are found to be the most accurate and reliable among the examined methods.},

abstract = {We present a parallel explicit/implicit time integration scheme well suited for block-adaptive grids. The basic idea of the algorithm is that the time stepping scheme can differ in the blocks of the grid for a given time step: an explicit scheme is used in the blocks where the local stability requirement is not violated and an implicit scheme is used in the blocks where the explicit scheme would be unstable. The implicit scheme is second order in time. The non-linear system of equations is linearized with Newton linearization. The linear system is solved with a preconditioned Krylov subspace iterative scheme. The Schwarz type preconditioning is also based on the block structure of the grid. We discuss load balancing for parallel execution and the optimal choice of the time step for speed and robustness. The parallel efficiency of the scheme is demonstrated for the equations of magnetohydrodynamics with a geophysics application in three dimensions. The control of the numerical divergence of the magnetic field in combination with the explicit/implicit time stepping scheme is also discussed. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The scheme is generalized to three-dimensional block-adaptive grids with Cartesian or generalized coordinates. The second order accurate discretization of the Hall term at grid resolution changes is described in detail. Both explicit and implicit time integration schemes are developed. The stability of the explicit time integration is ensured by including the whistler wave speed for the shortest discrete wave length into the numerical dissipation, but then second order accuracy requires the use of symmetric limiters in the total variation diminishing scheme. The implicit scheme employs a Newton-Krylov-Schwarz type approach, and can achieve significantly better efficiency than the explicit scheme with an appropriate preconditioner.

abstract = {We present a constrained formulation of Dedner et al.'s hyperbolic/parabolic divergence cleaning scheme for enforcing the ∇ {\textperiodcentered} B=0 constraint in smoothed particle magnetohydrodynamics (SPMHD) simulations. The constraint we impose is that energy removed must either be conserved or dissipated, such that the scheme is guaranteed to decrease the overall magnetic energy. This is shown to require use of conjugate numerical operators for evaluating ∇ {\textperiodcentered} B and ∇ $\psi$ in the SPMHD cleaning equations. The resulting scheme is shown to be stable at density jumps and free boundaries, in contrast to an earlier implementation by Price and Monaghan (2005). Optimal values of the damping parameter are found to be $\sigma$=0.2-0.3 in 2D and $\sigma$= 0.8-1.2 in 3D. With these parameters, our constrained Hamiltonian formulation is found to provide an effective means of enforcing the divergence constraint in SPMHD, typically maintaining average values of h|∇ {\textperiodcentered} B|/| B| to 0.1-1{\%}, up to an order of magnitude better than artificial resistivity without the associated dissipation in the physical field. Furthermore, when applied to realistic, 3D simulations we find an improvement of up to two orders of magnitude in momentum conservation with a corresponding improvement in numerical stability at essentially zero additional computational expense. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The method is based on the integral conservation laws and is dissipative, so that it can be used across shocks. The heart of the method is a one-dimensional Lagrangean scheme that may be regarded as a second-order sequel to Godunov's method. The second-order accuracy is achieved by taking the distributions of the state quantities inside a gas slab to be linear, rather than uniform as in Godunov's method. The Lagrangean results are remapped with least-squares accuracy onto the desired Euler grid in a separate step. Several monotonicity algorithms are applied to ensure positivity, monotonicity and nonlinear stability. Higher dimensions are covered through time splitting. Numerical results for one-dimensional and two-dimensional flows are presented, demonstrating the efficiency of the method.

abstract = {We consider magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) rectangular duct flows with volumetric heating. The flows are upward, subject to a strong transverse magnetic field perpendicular to the temperature gradient, such that the flow dynamics is quasi-two-dimensional. The internal volumetric heating imitates conditions of a blanket of a fusion power reactor, where a buoyancy-driven flow is imposed on the forced flow. Studies of this mixed-convection flow include analysis for the basic flow, linear stability analysis and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS)-type computations. The parameter range covers the Hartmann number (Ha) up to 500, the Reynolds number (Re) from 1000 to 10 000, and the Grashof number (Gr) from 10(5) to 5 x 10(8). The linear stability analysis predicts two primary instability modes: (i) bulk instability associated with the inflection point in the velocity profile near the "hot" wall and (ii) side-wall boundary layer instability. A mixed instability mode is also possible. An equation for the critical Hartmann number has been obtained as a function of Re and Gr. Effects of Ha, Re, and Gr on turbulent flows are addressed via nonlinear computations that demonstrate two characteristic turbulence regimes. In the "weak" turbulence regime, the induced vortices are localized near the inflection point of the basic velocity profile, while the boundary layer at the wall parallel to the magnetic field is slightly disturbed. In the "strong" turbulence regime, the bulk vortices interact with the boundary layer causing its destabilization and formation of secondary vortices that may travel across the flow, even reaching the opposite wall. In this regime, the key phenomena are vortex-wall and various vortex-vortex interactions. Flow and magnetic field effects on heat transfer are also analyzed. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

The governing equations are coupled nonlinear Navier-Stokes and nonlinear Maxwell's equations which are expressed in stream function, vorticity and magnetic stream function ($\psi$-$\omega$-A) formulation and decoupled energy equation. Apart from the usual kinetic Reynolds number Re, the parameters that governs the flow are magnetic Reynolds number Rm , Alfv{\'{e}}n number $\beta$ and Prandtl number Pr. The velocities of the flow are calculated with second order accurate based finite difference scheme and heat transfer equation is solved with fourth order accurate HOC scheme. The influence of the magnetic field and magnetic Reynolds number on velocity gradients is presented. It is found that the mean Nusselt number decreases until N ≤ 1 and then increases with further increase in the interaction parameter. It is also found that fluids having higher electrical conductivity can be effectively controlled with relatively low magnetic fields. The decrease in mean Nusselt number with $\beta$ and Rm is in agreement with experimental findings.},

abstract = {Analogies are elaborated in the qualitative description of two systems: the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow moving through a region where an external local magnetic field (magnetic obstacle) is applied and the ordinary hydrodynamic flow around a solid obstacle. The former problem is of interest both practically and theoretically, and the latter one is a classical problem being well understood in ordinary hydrodynamics. The first analogy is the formation in the MHD flow of an impenetrable region-core of the magnetic obstacle-as the interaction parameter N, i.e., strength of the applied magnetic field, increases significantly. The core of the magnetic obstacle is streamlined both by the upstream flow and by the induced cross-stream electric currents, such as a foreign insulated insertion placed inside the ordinary hydrodynamic flow. In the core, closed streamlines of the mass flow resemble contour lines of electric potential, while closed streamlines of the electric current resemble contour lines of pressure. The second analogy is the breaking away of attached vortices from the recirculation pattern produced by the magnetic obstacle when the Reynolds number Re, i.e., velocity of the upstream flow, is larger than a critical value. This breaking away of vortices from the magnetic obstacle is similar to that occurring past a solid obstacle. Depending on the inlet and/or initial conditions, the observed vortex shedding can be either symmetric or asymmetric. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

As an illustration, the following examples are considered: peakwise, stepwise, shelfwise inhomogeneous magnetic fields, and the field induced by a solenoid.

The problem is of fundamental importance in the design of liquid-lithium cooling systems for fusion reactors, of liquid-metal MHD generators and of MHD machinery in metallurgy. First we find that, if a straight pipe of radius r is joined to an expansion or contraction, then the disturbance of the fully developed flow in the pipe dies out like exp (- 12.16|x|r-1), where x is distance from the join. Next we consider the flow in conical expansions with end effects neglected; and find that the flow becomes concentrated near the plane of symmetry as the divergence increases. Finally numerical schemes for determining the flow in more general expansions and contractions are outlined. Extension of the present analysis to non-circular sections is also discussed. {\textcopyright} 1974.},

Braiding and twisting of magnetic field structures, which is caused by the convective flows at the solar surface, was suggested as an efficient mechanism for atmospheric heating. Convectively driven vortex flows that harbour magnetic fields are observed to be abundant in the photosphere (the visible surface of the Sun). Recently, corresponding swirling motions have been discovered in the chromosphere, the atmospheric layer sandwiched between the photosphere and the corona. Here we report the imprints of these chromospheric swirls in the transition region and low corona, and identify them as observational signatures of rapidly rotating magnetic structures. These ubiquitous structures, which resemble super-tornadoes under solar conditions, reach from the convection zone into the upper solar atmosphere and provide an alternative mechanism for channelling energy from the lower into the upper solar atmosphere.},

Flux is concentrated outside the eddy; within it, the field grows and its scale of variation decreases until resistive effects become important. Closed lines of force are then formed by reconnexion. The central field decays and a steady state is reached. Within a period, small compared with the characteristic time for resistive decay, magnetic flux is almost entirely expelled from regions of rapid motion and concentrated at the edges of convection cells. This process is demonstrated from numerical experiments. The results are applied to the sun, where the concentrated fields are strong enough to inhibit convection locally.},

abstract = {The plasmoid instability may lead to fast magnetic reconnection through long current sheets(CS). It is well known that large-Reynolds-number plasmas easily become turbulent. We address the question whether turbulence enhances the energy conversion rate of plasmoid-unstable current sheets. We carry out appropriate numerical MHD simulations, but resolving simultaneously the relevant large-scale (mean-) fields and the corresponding small-scale, turbulent, quantities by means of direct numerical simulations (DNS) is not possible. Hence we investigate the influence of small scale turbulence on large scale MHD processes by utilizing a subgrid-scale (SGS) turbulence model. We verify the applicability of our SGS model and then use it to investigate the influence of turbulence on the plasmoid instability. We start the simulations with Harris-type and force-free CS equilibria in the presence of a finite guide field in the direction perpendicular to the reconnection plane. We use the DNS results to investigate the growth of the plasmoid instability. The energy and cross-helicity due to turbulence are obtained in terms of the mean fields by a Gaussian filtering formulation from a Reynolds averaging turbulence model. The influence of turbulence on the reconnection rate of the plasmoid instability is investigated. To verify the predictions of the SGS-model, the electromotive force ({\$}{\{}\backslashbf\backslashcal{\{}E{\}}{\}}{\$}) is calculated for the coarse data obtained by filtering and compared to the SGS-model. The symmetry breakage with respect to the guide field direction causes a turbulent helicity which reduces the influence of the apparent turbulent resistivity. The reduced reconnection rate of guide field plasmoid reconnection is attributed to a balancing between the different physical effects related to turbulence.},

abstract = {A description is given for preserving {\$} {\AE} B\backslash0 in a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code that employs the upwind, total variation diminishing (TVD) scheme and Strang type operator splitting for multidi- mensionality. The method is based on the staggered mesh technique to constrain the transport of mag- netic Ðeld: the magnetic Ðeld components are deÐned at grid interfaces with their advective {\~{N}}uxes on grid edges, while other quantities are deÐned at grid centers. The magnetic Ðeld at grid centers for the upwind step is calculated by interpolating the values from grid interfaces. The advective {\~{N}}uxes on grid edges for the magnetic Ðeld evolution are calculated from the upwind {\~{N}}uxes at grid interfaces. Then the magnetic Ðeld can be maintained with {\$} {\AE} B$\backslash$0 exactly, if this is so initially, while the upwind scheme is used for the update of {\~{N}}uid quantities. The correctness of the code is demonstrated through tests com- paring numerical solutions either with analytic solutions or with numerical solutions from a code using an explicit divergence-cleaning method. Also, the robustness is shown through tests involving realistic astrophysical problems. Subject},

@article{Yu2010,
abstract = {Observationally, the change of acceleration of coronal mass ejections is commonly attributed to the change of the reconnection rate. In this study, we use a two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation with finite resistivity to study: (1) the forces that lead to the acceleration of the plasma and plasmoid and (2) the time evolution of the topological change of the magnetic flux across the current sheet. Our results show that the fast flows are not limited to the direction perpendicular to the local magnetic field. The fast parallel flows are accelerated by the parallel component of the pressure gradient force. The net force perpendicular to the magnetic field can accelerate the plasma and the plasmoid along the current sheet. The acceleration of the plasmoid is also controlled by the mass contained in the plasmoid. We find that the fast ejection of the plasmoid can stretch the current sheet and consequently reduce the magnetic reconnection/reconfiguration rate temporally before a new plasmoid is formed. We show that the topological change of the magnetic flux is due to the non-uniform magnetic annihilation rate along the current sheet. Therefore, the reconnection/reconfiguration site does not necessarily stay at the neutral point. It can move with the Y-line next to the bifurcated current sheets.},

abstract = {A necessary optimality condition for the minimum-drag shape for a non-magnetic solid body immersed in the uniform flow of an electrically conducting viscous incompressible fluid under the presence of a magnetic field is obtained. It is assumed that the flow and magnetic field are uniform and parallel at infinity, and that the body and fluid have the same magnetic permeability. The condition is derived based on the linearized magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations subject to a constraint on the body's volume, and generalizes the existing optimality conditions for the minimum-drag shapes for the body in the Stokes and Oseen flows of a non-conducting fluid. It is shown that for any Hartmann number M, Reynolds number Re and magnetic Reynolds number Rem, the minimum-drag shapes are fore-and-aft symmetric and have conic vertices with an angle of 2{\{}pi{\}}/3. The minimum-drag shapes are represented in a function-series form, and the series coefficients are found iteratively with the derived optimality condition. At each iteration, the MHD problem is solved via the boundary integral equations obtained based on the Cauchy integral formula for generalized analytic functions. With respect to the equal-volume sphere, drag reduction as a function of the Cowling number S=M2/(Rem Re) is smallest at S=1. Also, in the considered examples, the drag values for the minimum-drag shapes and equal-volume minimum-drag spheroids are sufficiently close.},

abstract = {A numerical method for solving three-dimensional, time-dependent incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in curvilinear coordinates is presented. The non-staggered-grid method originally developed by C. M. Rhie and W. L. Chow (AIAAJ.21, 1525 (1983)) for steady state problems is extended to compute unsteady flows. In the computational space, the Cartesian velocity components and the pressure are defined at the center of a control volume, while the volume fluxes are defined at the mid-point on their corresponding cell faces. The momentum equations are integrated semi-implicitly by the approximate factorization technique. The intermediate velocities are interpolated onto the faces of the control volume to form the source terms of the pressure Poisson equation, which is solved iteratively with a multigrid method. The compatibility condition of the pressure Poisson equation is satisfied in the same manner as in a staggered-grid method; mass conservation can be satisfied to machine accuracy. The pressure boundary condition is derived from the momentum equations. Solutions of both steady and unsteady problems including the large eddy simulation of a rotating and stratified upwelling flow in an irregular container established the favorable accuracy and efficiency of the present method.},

abstract = {Instability of a flow of an electrically conducting fluid in an annular channel is analyzed. Strong constant magnetic field is imposed in the axial direction. Similarly to toroidal duct experiments, the flow is driven by the azimuthal Lorentz force resulting from the interaction between the magnetic field and the radial electric currents created by a difference of electric potential imposed between the cylinders. The instability of the base flow, while clearly of centrifugal nature, is significantly different from the Dean instability detected earlier in hydrodynamic systems and similar MHD systems at low and moderate magnetic fields. Growing perturbations are oscillating and axisymmetric and consist of counter-rotating toroidal vortices arranged side by side in the radial direction and having meridional cross-sections in the form of elongated ellipses oriented slightly obliquely to the axial direction. Simulations of the secondary flow show an interesting feature of periodic transitions between two symmetric solutions.},
