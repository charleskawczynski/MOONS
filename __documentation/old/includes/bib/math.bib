abstract = {On the occasion of the third centenary of the appointment of Johann Bernoulli at the University of Groningen, a number of linear systems solvers for some Laplace-like equations have been compared during a one-day workshop. CPU times of several advanced solvers measured on the same computer (an HP-755 workstation) are presented, which makes it possible to draw clear conclusions about the performance of these solvers.

@article{VanLeer1997,
abstract = {A method of second-order accuracy is described for integrating the equations of ideal compressible flow. The method is based on the integral conservation laws and is dissipative, so that it can be used across shocks. The heart of the method is a one-dimensional Lagrangean scheme that may be regarded as a second-order sequel to Godunov's method. The second-order accuracy is achieved by taking the distributions of the state quantities inside a gas slab to be linear, rather than uniform as in Godunov's method. The Lagrangean results are remapped with least-squares accuracy onto the desired Euler grid in a separate step. Several monotonicity algorithms are applied to ensure positivity, monotonicity, and nonlinear stability. Higher dimensions are covered through time splitting. Numerical results for one-dimensional and two-dimensional flows are presented, demonstrating the efficiency of the method. The paper concludes with a summary of the results of the whole series “Towards the Ultimate Conservative Difference Scheme.”},

@article{Perot1993,
abstract = {The fractional step method for solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in primitive variables is analyzed as a block LU decomposition. In this formulation the issues involving boundary conditions for the intermediate velocity variables and the pressure are clearly resolved. In addition, it is shown that poor temporal accuracy (first-order) is not due to boundary conditions, but due to the method itself. A generalized block LU decomposition that overcomes this difficulty is presented, allowing arbitrarily high temporal order of accuracy. The generalized decomposition is shown to be useful for a wide range of problems including steady problems. Technical issues, such as stability and the appropriate pressure update scheme, are also addressed. Numerical simulations of the unsteady, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a square domain confirm the theoretical results.},

As the performance of the methods generally depends on the characteristics of the problems to be solved, a judicious choice between the methods will require knowledge about the system. The aim of this paper is to review the properties of the various iteration methods, in order to assist the user in making a deliberate selection.},
