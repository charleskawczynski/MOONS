The fluid Prandtl number is taken as 6 representing water. The effects of inclination of the cavity on the flow and thermal fields are investigated for inclination angles ranging from 0?? to 30??. Interesting behaviours of the flow and thermal fields with increasing inclination are observed. The streamline and isotherm plots and the variation of the local and average Nusselt numbers at the hot and cold walls are presented. The average Nusselt number is found to increase with cavity inclination. The rate of increase of the average Nusselt number with cavity inclination is mild for dominating forced convection case while it is much steeper in dominating natural convection case. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Albensoeder2001,
abstract = {The classical rectangular lid-driven-cavity problem is considered in which the motion of an incompressible fluid is induced by a single lid moving tangentially to itself with constant velocity. In a system infinitely extended in the spanwise direction the flow is two-dimensional for small Reynolds numbers. By a linear stability analysis it is shown that this basic flow becomes unstable at higher Reynolds numbers to four different three-dimensional modes depending on the aspect ratio of the cavity's cross section. For shallow cavities the most dangerous modes are a pair of three-dimensional short waves propagating spanwise in the direction perpendicular to the basic flow. The mode is localized on the strong basic-state eddy that is created at the downstream end of the moving lid when the Reynolds number is increased. In the limit of a vanishing layer depth the critical Reynolds number approaches a finite asymptotic value. When the depth of the cavity is comparable to its width, two different centrifugal-instability modes can appear depending on the exact value of the aspect ratio. One of these modes is stationary, the other one is oscillatory. For unit aspect ratio ?square cavity?, the critical mode is stationary and has a very short wavelength. Experiments for the square cavity with a large span confirm this instability. It is argued that this three-dimensional mode has not been observed in all previous experiments, because the instability is suppressed by side-wall effects in small-span cavities. For large aspect ratios, i.e., for deep cavities, the critical three-dimensional mode is stationary with a long wavelength. The critical Reynolds number approaches a finite asymptotic value in the limit of an infinitely deep cavity.},

abstract = {This paper considers the accuracy of projection method approximations to the initial–boundary-value problem for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. The issue of how to correctly specify numerical boundary conditions for these methods has been outstanding since the birth of the second-order methodology a decade and a half ago. It has been observed that while the velocity can be reliably computed to second-order accuracy in time and space, the pressure is typically only first-order accurate in the L∞-norm. This paper identifies the source of this problem in the interplay of the global pressure-update formula with the numerical boundary conditions and presents an improved projection algorithm which is fully second-order accurate, as demonstrated by a normal mode analysis and numerical experiments. In addition, a numerical method based on a gauge variable formulation of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, which provides another option for obtaining fully second-order convergence in both velocity and pressure, is discussed. The connection between the boundary conditions for projection methods and the gauge method is explained in detail.},

@article{Saha2000,
abstract = {Direct Numerical Simulation of unsteady, two-dimensional flow past a square cylinder placed centrally in a channel has been carried out using a higher order finite difference scheme. A Reynolds number of 100 has been considered in the computation. The flow in the wake is found to be unsteady with a strong periodic component. The instantaneous vorticity field at this Reynolds number is seen to be spatially coherent. Maps of stress components formed from the oscillatory components of the velocity field ũ and ṽ show double peaks in ũũ and ũṽ but a single peak in ṽṽ. The maps are seen to be symmetric about the centreline of the flowspace. The results obtained in the present work are qualitatively similar to the phase-averaged plots from the experiments reported at high Reynolds numbers. Hence, the primary conclusion of the present study is that the unsteady flows with one or a few dominating frequencies (periodic or quasi-periodic) are statistically similar to a fully turbulent flow. To assess the similarity further, the energy transfer mechanism between the mean motion and the fluctuations has been studied through different terms associated with kinetic energy budget of the fluctuating velocities. The total pressure, the advection of the time-mean flow and production terms are found to be primarily responsible for the energy cascade. In contrast, diffusion and dissipation do not appear to have a significant influence on the energy transfer mechanism.},

@article{Tatsumi1990,
abstract = {The stability of the laminar flow in a rectangular duct of an arbitrary aspect ratio is investigated numerically by expanding the flow fields of both the main flow and the disturbance into series of Legendre polynomials and solving the eigenvalue problem of the resulting matrix equation. The stability of the flow is found to depend upon the aspect ratio of the duct and the mode of the disturbance. The flow is unstable to two of the four possible modes of different parity and stable to the other two. With respect to the most unstable mode, the flow is stable or unstable according as the aspect ratio is below or above a critical value of 3.2 respectively, and the critical Reynolds number decreases monotonically with increasing aspect ratio towards the known value of 5772 for plane Poiseuille flow. The flow field of the disturbance shows the existence of strong vortex layers along the critical layer at which the velocity equals the phase velocity of the disturbance.},
