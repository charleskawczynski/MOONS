abstract = {We propose a new activity on verification and validation (V{\&}V) of MHD codes presently employed by the fusion community as a predictive capability tool for liquid metal cooling applications, such as liquid metal blankets. The important steps in the development of MHD codes starting from the 1970s are outlined first and then basic MHD codes, which are currently in use by designers of liquid breeder blankets, are reviewed. A benchmark database of five problems has been proposed to cover a wide range of MHD flows from laminar fully developed to turbulent flows, which are of interest for fusion applications: (A) 2D fully developed laminar steady MHD flow, (B) 3D laminar, steady developing MHD flow in a non-uniform magnetic field, (C) quasi-two-dimensional MHD turbulent flow, (D) 3D turbulent MHD flow, and (E) MHD flow with heat transfer (buoyant convection). Finally, we introduce important details of the proposed activities, such as basic V{\&}V rules and schedule. The main goal of the present paper is to help in establishing an efficient V{\&}V framework and to initiate benchmarking among interested parties. The comparison results computed by the codes against analytical solutions and trusted experimental and numerical data as well as code-to-code comparisons will be presented and analyzed in companion paper/papers.},

abstract = {We review previous studies on instabilities and transitions in magnetohydrodynamic flows in a special context of liquid-metal blanket applications. In the past, possible transitions in blanket flows were mostly attributed to instabilities in the Hartmann layers. More recent studies show, however, that the side layers can experience instabilities at sufficiently lower Reynolds numbers. This suggests that in the blanket flows, the appearance of turbulence can most likely be related to the side rather than Hartmann layers. Various factors that may affect stability in blanket flows have been discussed. In particular, buoyancy forces can result in potentially unstable inflectional velocity profiles. First computational results, illustrating possibility of instabilities and quasi-two-dimensional turbulence in vertical mixed-convection flows heated volumetrically are presented. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The dual-coolant lead-lithium (DCLL) blanket concept is considered in the US for testing in ITER and as a candidate for using in DEMO reactor. In this blanket, the eutectic alloy lead-lithium circulates slowly as a coolant and breeder in the presence of a strong plasma-confining magnetic field, experiencing magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects. This paper overviews the ongoing studies for the MHD flows in the US DCLL blanket, focusing mostly on the poloidal flows where most of the volumetric heating is deposited and the MHD effects are therefore of primary importance. The paper introduces qualitative description of MHD flows in the blanket along with mathematical models and numerical and analytical results to address such phenomena as the near-wall jet formation, quasi-two-dimensional MHD turbulence, and buoyant flows. Special consideration is given to the buoyancy effects in the buoyancy-opposed flows, where superposition of forced and buoyant flows may lead to locally reverse or recirculation flows. The present analysis suggests that such flows are possible both in ITER and DEMO scenarios. We also discuss conditions when the poloidal flows in the blanket turn to be turbulent. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The code includes a finite-volume formulation, automatically generated Hartmann number sensitive meshes, and effective convergence acceleration technique. Tests performed at Ha âˆ¼ 104 have showed very good accuracy. As an illustration, two blanket flows have been considered: Pb-17Li flow in a channel with a silicon carbide flow channel insert, and Li flow in a channel with insulating coating. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The magnetohydrodynamic flow of a liquid metal coolant through a square duct is modeled in three dimensions to study the development of the flow in the entry region of a fusion reactor blanket. The effect of various wall conductivity configurations on the heat transfer capability and pressure gradient requirements is also investigated. The three momentum, three induction, pressure and energy equations are cast in parabolic form and integrated numerically by the use of a marching procedure in the stream direction. Mesh size limitations restrict the flow to low Hartmann numbers. The results show a smooth and rapid development of the flow over a length which is sensitive to the Hartmann number. Velocity and temperature profiles are flattened and heat transfer coefficients are increased. The calculations for mixed wall conductivities show that it is possible to increase heat transfer capabilities of the flow significantly by selectively insulating the corners of the ducts. {\textcopyright} 1979.},
