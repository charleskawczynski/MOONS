% How to include packages and includes

% In the main tex file:
\newcommand{\PSCHAIN}{..}
\input{../prepend_PS_chain}
\newcommand{\rootdir}{\PSCHAIN}
\input{\PSCHAIN/includes/includes}

% In all subfolders, except those without subfolders, make a file named prepend_PS_chain.tex with contents:
\edef\PSCHAIN{../\PSCHAIN}
\input{\PSCHAIN/prepend_PS_chain}

% The file prepend_PS_chain.tex in the root directory needs special content:
\edef\PSCHAIN{\PSCHAIN/LATEX_INCLUDES}
