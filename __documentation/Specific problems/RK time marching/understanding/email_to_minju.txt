Hi Dr Mingjiu Ni,

This is Charlie, from the UCLA fusion group. I was hoping to see if we could schedule a time to have a meeting over the phone to discuss some of the details of two of your papers. I recently finished my prospectus, and one of the professors (John Kim) made a suggestion that I am struggling with.

And the most relevant papers I found, about the suggestion that Professor Kim made, was two of your papers, hence why I am reaching out to you.

Please let me know if and when we can schedule a meeting over the phone at your earliest convenience.

I appreciate your time.

Important notes regarding the papers:


paper I
	Four-step projection method I (equation 8-11)
		(JxB)^{k+1} appears on the RHS, how is this computed???

paper II
	"Usually an explicit Rungeâ€“Kutta technique can be employed for update of the convective term for simplicity, and an implicit technique is used for update of the diffusion term for stability."
		I have not seen any RK methods used in incompressible MHD simulations for segragated solvers, can you please point me to one?
