First note that there is no pressure force along x, and since the flow is periodic in x, the only way for flow to be driven in x requires a non-zero $\J \CROSS \B$ force, which doesn't exist since the applied magnetic field induces currents in planes of x, resulting in a $\J \CROSS \B$ only in planes of x. In addition, let's assume that the applied magnetic field does not induce any currents ($\CURL B^0=0$). Therefore, using the $\PD_x () = 0$, and $u = 0$, the momentum equations become

\begin{equation}
	u=0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\PD v}{\PD t}
	+ \frac{\PD (v v)}{\PD y}
	+ \frac{\PD (v w)}{\PD z}
	=
	- \frac{\PD p}{\PD y}
	+ \frac{1}{Re}
	\left(
	\frac{\PD^2 v}{\PD y^2}
	+\frac{\PD^2 v}{\PD z^2}
	\right)
	+ \frac{Ha^2}{Re}
	(\J \CROSS (\B^{tot}))_y
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\PD w}{\PD t}
	+ \frac{\PD (w v)}{\PD y}
	+ \frac{\PD (w w)}{\PD z}
	=
	- \frac{\PD p}{\PD z}
	+ \frac{1}{Re}
	\left(
	\frac{\PD^2 w}{\PD y^2}
	+\frac{\PD^2 w}{\PD z^2}
	\right)
	+ \frac{Ha^2}{Re}
	(\J \CROSS (\B^{tot}))_z
\end{equation}

Where

\begin{equation}
	B^{tot} = B^0 + B
\end{equation}

\subsection{Induction equation}

The induction equation in its general form is

\begin{equation}
	\PD_t B_i
	=
	- \PD_t B_i^0
	- \PD_j (u_j B_i^{tot} - u_i B_j^{tot})
	+
	\frac{1}{Re_m}
	\PD_{jj} B_i
\end{equation}

First note that there is only a source term for the induced magnetic field for the x-component. This means that, since the initial induced magnetic field is zero, the y and z components of the induced magnetic field are always zero. Using this fact, $\PD_x ()=0$, the uniform $\sigma$, and uniform $\mu$, the induction equations become


\begin{equation}
	\PD_t B_x
	=
	- \PD_t B_x^0
	- \PD_y (v B_x^{tot})
	- \PD_z (w B_x^{tot})
	+ \frac{1}{Re_m}
	\left(
	\PD_{yy} B_x
	+
	\PD_{zz} B_x
	\right)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	B_y = B_z = 0
\end{equation}

\subsection{Lorentz force}

Looking back at the momentum equation, the $\J \CROSS \B$ force does not act in x, and we only have one component of the magnetic field, so we have

\begin{equation}
	(\J \CROSS \B^{tot})_x = 0
	\qquad \qquad
	(\J \CROSS \B^{tot})_y = - B_x^{tot} \frac{\PD B_x}{\PD y}
	\qquad \qquad
	(\J \CROSS \B^{tot})_z = - B_x^{tot} \frac{\PD B_x}{\PD z}
\end{equation}
