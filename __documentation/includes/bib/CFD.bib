@article{Ding2006,
abstract = {In this paper, the local multiquadric differential quadrature (LMQDQ) method is applied on three-dimensional incompressible flow problems. The LMQDQ method is among the newly proposed mesh-free methods. Unlike the traditional differential quadrature (DQ) method, the weighting coefficients of LMQDQ method are determined by using the radial basis functions (RBFs) as the trial functions instead of high-order polynomials. The main concern of this paper is to discuss the effectiveness of using LMQDQ method to solve 3-D incompressible Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in the primitive-variable form. Three-dimensional lid-driven cavity flow problem with Reynolds numbers of 100, 400 and 1000 was chosen as a test case to validate the LMQDQ method. The computed velocity profiles along the vertical and horizontal centerlines are given and compared with available data in the literature. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Direct Numerical Simulation of unsteady, two-dimensional flow past a square cylinder placed centrally in a channel has been carried out using a higher order finite difference scheme. A Reynolds number of 100 has been considered in the computation. The flow in the wake is found to be unsteady with a strong periodic component. The instantaneous vorticity field at this Reynolds number is seen to be spatially coherent. Maps of stress components formed from the oscillatory components of the velocity field ũ and ṽ show double peaks in ũũ and ũṽ but a single peak in ṽṽ. The maps are seen to be symmetric about the centreline of the flowspace. The results obtained in the present work are qualitatively similar to the phase-averaged plots from the experiments reported at high Reynolds numbers. Hence, the primary conclusion of the present study is that the unsteady flows with one or a few dominating frequencies (periodic or quasi-periodic) are statistically similar to a fully turbulent flow. To assess the similarity further, the energy transfer mechanism between the mean motion and the fluctuations has been studied through different terms associated with kinetic energy budget of the fluctuating velocities. The total pressure, the advection of the time-mean flow and production terms are found to be primarily responsible for the energy cascade. In contrast, diffusion and dissipation do not appear to have a significant influence on the energy transfer mechanism.},

abstract = {A new second-order time-accurate fractional-step method for solving unsteady incompressible Navier–Stokes equations on hybrid unstructured grids is presented. The nonstaggered grid method, originally developed by Rhie and Chow (1983, AIAA J.21, 1525) for steady flow and further extended by Zang et al. (1994, J. Comput. Phys.114, 18) to unsteady flow on structured grids, is employed in the present study to enforce mass conservation on hybrid unstructured grids. The pressure and Cartesian velocity components are defined at the center of each cell, while the face-normal velocities are defined at the mid-points of the corresponding cell faces. A second-order fully implicit time-advancement scheme is used for time integration and the resulting nonlinear equations are linearized without losing the overall time accuracy. Both the momentum and Poisson equations are integrated with the finite volume method and the flow variables at the cell face are obtained using an interpolation scheme independent of cell shape. The present numerical method is applied to four different benchmark problems and proves to be accurate and efficient.},

abstract = {A separated turbulent boundary layer over a flat plate was investigated by direct numerical simulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. A suction-blowing velocity distribution was prescribed along the upper boundary of the computational domain to create an adverse-to- favourable pressure gradient that produces a closed separation bubble. The Reynolds number based on inlet free- stream velocity and momentum thickness is 300. Neither instantaneous detachment nor reattachment points are fixed in space but fluctuate significantly. The mean detachment and reattachment locations determined by three different definitions, i.e. (i) location of 50{\%} forward flow fraction, (ii) mean dividing streamline ( phi =0), (iii) location of zero wall-shear stress ( tau /sub w/=0), are in good agreement. Instantaneous vorticity contours show that the turbulent structures emanating upstream of separation move upwards into the shear layer in the detachment region and then turn around the bubble. The locations of the maximum turbulence intensities as well as Reynolds shear stress occur in the middle of the shear layer. In the detached flow region, Reynolds shear stresses and their gradients are large away from the wall and thus the largest pressure fluctuations are in the middle of the shear layer. Iso- surfaces of negative pressure fluctuations which correspond to the core region of the vortices show that large-scale structures grow in the shear layer and agglomerate. They then impinge on the wall and subsequently convect downstream. The characteristic Strouhal number St=f delta (in)*/U/sub 0/ associated with this motion ranges from 0.0025 to 0.01. The kinetic energy budget in the detachment region is very similar to that of a plane mixing layer (39 Refs.)},

abstract = {Turbulent flow over a backward-facing step is studied by direct numerical solution of the Navier–Stokes equations. The simulation was conducted at a Reynolds number of 5100 based on the step height h and inlet free-stream velocity, and an expansion ratio of 1.20. Temporal behaviour of spanwise-averaged pressure fluctuation contours and reattachment length show evidence of an approximate periodic behaviour of the free shear layer with a Strouhal number of 0.06. The instantaneous velocity fields indicate that the reattachment location varies in the spanwise direction, and oscillates about a mean value of 6.28h. Statistical results show excellent agreement with experimental data by Jovic {\&} Driver (1994). Of interest are two observations not previously reported for the backward-facing step flow: (a) at the relatively low Reynolds number considered, large negative skin friction is seen in the recirculation region; the peak |Cf| is about 2.5 times the value measured in experiments at high Reynolds numbers; (b) the velocity profiles in the recovery region fall below the universal log-law. The deviation of the velocity profile from the log-law indicates that the turbulent boundary layer is not fully recovered at 20 step heights behind the separation. The budgets of all Reynolds stress components have been computed. The turbulent kinetic energy budget in the recirculation region is similar to that of a turbulent mixing layer. The turbulent transport term makes a significant contribution to the budget and the peak dissipation is about 60{\%} of the peak production. The velocity–pressure gradient correlation and viscous diffusion are negligible in the shear layer, but both are significant in the near-wall region. This trend is seen throughout the recirculation and reattachment region. In the recovery region, the budgets show that effects of the free shear layer are still present.},

abstract = {A numerical method for solving three-dimensional, time-dependent incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in curvilinear coordinates is presented. The non-staggered-grid method originally developed by C. M. Rhie and W. L. Chow (AIAAJ.21, 1525 (1983)) for steady state problems is extended to compute unsteady flows. In the computational space, the Cartesian velocity components and the pressure are defined at the center of a control volume, while the volume fluxes are defined at the mid-point on their corresponding cell faces. The momentum equations are integrated semi-implicitly by the approximate factorization technique. The intermediate velocities are interpolated onto the faces of the control volume to form the source terms of the pressure Poisson equation, which is solved iteratively with a multigrid method. The compatibility condition of the pressure Poisson equation is satisfied in the same manner as in a staggered-grid method; mass conservation can be satisfied to machine accuracy. The pressure boundary condition is derived from the momentum equations. Solutions of both steady and unsteady problems including the large eddy simulation of a rotating and stratified upwelling flow in an irregular container established the favorable accuracy and efficiency of the present method.},

abstract = {The fractional step method for solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in primitive variables is analyzed as a block LU decomposition. In this formulation the issues involving boundary conditions for the intermediate velocity variables and the pressure are clearly resolved. In addition, it is shown that poor temporal accuracy (first-order) is not due to boundary conditions, but due to the method itself. A generalized block LU decomposition that overcomes this difficulty is presented, allowing arbitrarily high temporal order of accuracy. The generalized decomposition is shown to be useful for a wide range of problems including steady problems. Technical issues, such as stability and the appropriate pressure update scheme, are also addressed. Numerical simulations of the unsteady, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a square domain confirm the theoretical results.},
